### TANK BLUEPRINT IMAGES
Those files are ported from vanilla with the following changes:
- tag in file name changed (for exmaple, from _sov to _rus)
- container name changed to support a new tag:
```
containerWindowType = {
	name = "equipment_designer_light_tank_destroyer_chassis_fra" - > name = "equipment_designer_light_tank_destroyer_chassis_nfa"
```
