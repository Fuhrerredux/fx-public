### History
HUN_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "In the chaos that engulfed Europe following the traumatic and brutal Great War, Hungary found herself as one of the war’s great losers. Having been cut down to a rump state before having an Entente-friendly government imposed on her, there could be no greater disgrace for the once proud nation.\n\nA new age dawns however. Just as the Germans rose against the injustice of Versailles, the Hungarians rose against Trianon in 1932, electing the radical Arrow-Cross movement in a coalition with other far-right parties. There can only be two futures for Hungary now - revision or ruination."

POLITICS_FERENC_SZALASI_DESC: "Ferenc Szálasi, the founder of the Hungarist movement and Nemzetvezető of Hungary, was born in 1897 in Košice to a soldier's family with Armenian origins. From his mother, whom he lived with until his ascension to power, he inherited her devout Greek catholic belief. From his father, he inherited the family tradition of serving in the army. As soon as Ferenc completed his elementary education he attended the military academy in Kőszeg, Târgu Mureș, Eisenstadt, and Wiener Neustadt, after which he was promoted to Lieutenant in 1915. During the Great War Szálasi served in the Austro-Hungarian army on both the Italian and French fronts. After the war, he remained largely apolitical. In 1925 he became a well-respected member of the General Staff. During his time there, his political views matured into Hungarism and began to see himself as the sole man capable of leading his mutilated country to its former glory. In 1930 he wrote his book, The Plan for the Building of the Hungarian State as a summary of his ideology and sent it to many prominent figures, causing him to be expelled from the General Staff. In 1931 he left the army altogether and focused on founding the Hungarist movement. Although being considered a green bolshevik by the upper-class, a madman by other politicians, and having no international reputation, Szálasi managed to sway the hearts of the common people. His party won the 1932 general elections and has been ruling the nation for 4 years."

hun.1.t: "Hungary, A Nation Destroyed"
hun.1.d: "With the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1919, the new Hungarian Republic found itself with enemies on all sides. In the chaos of the postwar world, a socialist state was declared in Budapest - with promises to protect the territorial integrity of the fledgling nation from her furious neighbours.\n\nHowever, the Hungarian Soviet Republic was but a short lived experiment. With counterrevolutionaries forming in Szeged, a joint Entente-led invasion of Hungary took place. The outcome was thus partition, with its territory handed out to its victorious neighbors.\n\nIn defiance of the desires of the Hungarian counterrevolutionaries however, the Entente would soon restore the budding Hungarian Republic, with the surrounding countries desiring to curb all Hungarian ambitions. With now-president Mihály Károlyi’s return, Hungary would enter an era of republicanism - marked by fury over the disgrace of Trianon and growing tensions within the rump state.\n\nIn this vacuum, the new nation would look both outwards and inwards for a new way forward. With the crash of 1929 wrecking the hopes of the young republic, radical new forces would begin rising and none quite like the new Arrow Cross movement - led by the young officer Ferenc Szálasi. Promising further land reform and alleviation to the workers, Szálasi’s movement would soon begin to rapidly grow to pre-eminence, becoming the largest far-right movement in the republic. Cooperating with other far-right movements, the Party of National Unity would soon take over following the elections of 1932. As the nationalist coalition continues to consolidate itself in power, it eyes with great hunger the territories that had been stolen in 1920 - for only through their reclamation shall the revival of the Magyars be complete."
hun.1.a: "Nem! Nem! Soha!"
###
hun.2.t: "Hungary wishes to purchase weapons"
hun.2.d: "The Hungarian government has been moving towards a policy of secret rearmament, and they have approached us with a request to purchase weapons from our stockpile in order to arm the military they plan on building. Giving the Hungarians some weapons could turn them into a useful ally in the future, and it may lead to the intertwining of our economies."
hun.2.a: "We will send them many guns!"
hun.2.b: "We will send them some guns."
hun.2.c: "We cannot spare any weapons!"
###
hun.3.t: "Germany sends us weapons!"
hun.3.d: "We have received word from the German government, they have agreed to secretly send guns into the nation that will be added to our national stockpile. This is a valuable step in the rearmament of our nation and the rebuilding of our army."
hun.3.a: "One step closer to victory."
###
hun.4.t: "Germany denies us weapons"
hun.4.d: "The German Government has officially denied our request to purchase several thousand weapons from their stockpile for use in our army. We will have to produce our own weapons with our own factories it would seem."
hun.4.a: "Such a shame"
###
hun.5.t: "Hungary demands the return of Transylvania"
hun.5.d: "After months of seemingly unchecked military buildup and expansion, the Hungarian government has decided to send a formal demand of the territories of all land east of the Tisza river and west of the Carpathian mountains. This would mean the surrender of Transylvania, Banat, and over one million ethnic Romanians currently living within our borders. Accepting this demand would be a national tragedy and completely destroy any national prestige we currently hold."
hun.5.a: "We are not afraid of the Hungarian menace!"
hun.5.b: "We cannot afford a war with the Hungarians."
###
hun.6.t: "Romania refuses to return Transylvania"
hun.6.d: "The Romanian government has officially declined our demands for Transylvania, and diplomatic ties have very quickly broken down into silence. We have been left with no other options, we must liberate Transylvania by force."
hun.6.a: "Then it is war..."
###
hun.7.t: "Romania cedes Transylvania"
hun.7.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the Romanian government has accepted all of our territorial demands and has begun the complete military evacuation of Transylvania, making way for our soldiers to march in and occupy the cities with no resistance. This is a glorious day in Hungarian history, and will be known for all time as our 'reclaimation day'."
hun.7.a: "Hungarians everywhere rejoice in your liberation!"
###
hun.8.t: "Hungary demands Alföld"
hun.8.d: "The Hungarian government has sent us a small list of demands today, including the return of the territory of Alföld. The lands of Alföld were occupied in 1920 and the Tisza river was set up as the natural border between Hungary and Romania. Soon however, the lands proved to be economically unviable and unrest in the lands was always higher than the rest of Transylvania and Banat. While we would be surrendering a valuable defensive border, perhaps returning the land is the best choice for the continued stability and prosperity of Romania. Perhaps the Hungarians will be satisfied with Alföld, and stop persuing further territorial demands."
hun.8.a: "Not an inch of ground will be ceded!"
hun.8.b: "Give Alföld back to Hungary."
###
hun.9.t: "Romania refuses to cede Alföld"
hun.9.d: "Sadly, the Romanian government has refused our offer to take control over Alföld, and we have been left with only one option; to take it back with force."
hun.9.a: "We will be in Budapest by the end of the month"
###
hun.10.t: "Romania transfers Alföld"
hun.10.d: "The Romanian government has responded to our offer, and they have agreed to transfer the land of Alföld back to Hungary. The Romanian soliders are evacuating the region and our militia are walking into the cities with no resistance, and we are in fact being welcomed with joy from the local residents."
hun.10.a: "First Alföld, next Transylvania."
###
hun.11.t: "Transylvanian Volunteers arive in Hungary!"
hun.11.d: "It would seem that our jingoistic spirit towards the reclaimation of Alföld and Transylvania has sparked some nationalism across the region, flocks of volunteer soldiers using stolen Romanian equipment are arriving across the Tizsa river and have sworn allegiance to our regime. They will surely come in handy in the reclaimation of Alföld and Transylvania, and we can expect more volunteers to arrive the longer we wait."
hun.11.a: "Rise, Magyars everywhere!"
###
hun.12.t: "Hungarian volunteers rise up in Transylvania!"
hun.12.d: "Following our invasion of Romania, several groups of Hungarians living in Transylvania have taken up arms and pledged their alliegance to the Hungarian state."
hun.12.a: "Wonderful."
###
hun.13.t: "Liberation Day"
hun.13.d: "July 7 1932.\n\nA date which all Hungarians should remember, for it is the day that our liberation officially begun. We have worked tirelessly and endlessly to restore the Hungarian state to the glory it once held, before the Western Imperialists sought to impose their will upon us, and skewer us upon a pike outside the palace at Versallies. The liberation of all Hungarians around the world is at hand, and we are reaching ever closer to our goal of ethnic hegemony by the day. But we must not diminish our resolve, we must remain steadfast and hardy, and prepare for the wars and battles that are to come. Only when all our foes lie dead before us can we say the day is done, only when all Magyars live under one state can we say that our destiny has been acomplished."
hun.13.a: "Arise, Magyars everywhere!"
###
hun.15.t: "Democratic rallies in Pécs"
hun.15.d: "Following the election of the Arrow Cross party in Hungary, several democratic groups formed a coalition party under the banner of the F48P in opposition and protest. This party remains the only large political group that could pose any sort of threat towards us and our grip on the nation. While it is extremely unlikely that this party will stand any chance of actually toppling our regime, it would still be in our best interests to curtail their influence and power. We could put a large effort into diminishing the power of the F48P, but it may not be wise to cause mass agitation before we have secured our powerbase."
hun.15.a: "Take extensive measures to curtail their power"
hun.15.b: "Take reasonable measures to curtail their power"
hun.15.c: "They are not a threat to us."
###
hun.16.t: "Gaszton Gaál assassinated!"
hun.16.d: "The FKgP party was founded recently in Hungarian history, in the year 1930. The party rose to prominance in response to the collapsing Hungarian economy and its effect on the agrarian population in the country. While never winning or contesting any elections, the party managed to pressure the government into implimenting slight reforms that made life a little easier on the farmers. Still, this was not enough, and food production in Hungary has always teetered on the brink of inadequacy. Gaszton Gaál was perhaps the most vocal member of the party, and ran in local elections under the FKgP's banner. While the majority of the party broke off to form a coalition under the F48P, a very small fringe group of hardline members stuck around to keep the spirit of the party alive. While not the official leader of the party, Gaszton was reportedly in the city of Dunaújváros attempting to gather support for his party when a shot rung out from somewhere in the crowd, and Gaszton fell to the ground. This event has shook what remaining members the party had to their core, and support for the FKgP is dwindling to the point where popular support for the party is practically nonexistant. While the gunman's identity remains unknown, he is believed to be a member of the Arrow Cross, seemingly looking to protect our interests by resorting to such barbaric acts as political assassination!"
hun.16.a: "Interesting"
###
hun.17.t: "Factory bombing in Budapest!"
hun.17.d: "Explosions could be heard coming from the industrial district near the nations capital yesterday, as several explosive devices were set off inside a factory. The attack occured around 10am today, as the factory workers were just beginning their shifts. Several men were killed and dozens more injured as a large portion of the factory collapsed due to a loss of structural integrety. An investigation is currently ongoing to find the motive behind this attack, but it is clear that dark forces are at work trying to undermine our power."
hun.17.a: "How unfortunate."
###
hun.18.t: "Socialists caused the bombing!"
hun.18.d: "The investigation into the factory bombing that took place 6 days ago has finally concluded, with the detectives finally determining that it was a radicalized member of the Balközép party by the name of Biró Ferenc who planted the bombs before slipping away into the countryside. The detectives found a copy of the Communist Manifesto adressed to him by someone named Mátyás Rákosi, and a full investigation has begun into the lives of these two men. Security around the city of Budapest has been increased, and anyone accused to being a socialist is shunned from their family and public life. This "red scare" is vastly diminishing the influence that the reds hold in the fringes of our country. It would appear that some good has come of this tragedy after all."
hun.18.a: "Damned reds..."
###
hun.19.t: "The Hungarian Economy"
hun.19.d: "Following Hungary's defeat in the Great War, a series of revolutions and counter-revolutions took place across the nation, until a combined army of French, Serbian, Romanian, and Czechoslovak soldiers entered Budapest and restored order. The democratic government put in place was little more than a puppet to the Serbs and Romanians, and with each coming election the Hungarian election entered a sharper and deeper decline. These events culminated in the September 23rd riots which in 1928 saw thousands of civilians take to the streets in order to physically take money from the banks that were withholding it. These riots destroyed many banks, and faith in the economy was completely shattered when the Hungarian government declared the currency null and void in an attempt to combat the hyperinflation gripping the nation. The Romanians and Serbs that were allegedly "protecting" the Hungarian people were content to sit and watch as the Hungarian nation collapsed in on itself. It was this complete economic ruin, combined with a feeling of utter betrayal by Hungary's neighbors, that led to the rise of the popular Arrow Cross party, and their landslide victory in the 1932 general election."
hun.19.a: "Repairing the economy must be our top priority!"
###
hun.20.t: "The Legalization of Unions"
hun.20.d: "Trade Unions have been illegal in Hungary since the government banned them in 1926 out of a fear of rising socialism in the nation. With the Arrow Cross in firm control of the country, perhaps it is time we re-evaluated the national stance on the legality of Unions."
hun.20.a: "Unions will never be legalized!"
hun.20.b: "Perhaps some liberalization isn't a bad idea..."
###
hun.21.t: "Hungary demands the return of Southern Slovakia!"
hun.21.d: "Following the renunciation of the Treaty of Trianon, the Hungarian state has begun to rebuild their military to unprecidented heights. They now seek to challenge our authority over the historically Slovak lands that border their nation and have sent a formal demand for the "return" of those lands to Hungarian rule. accepting this demand will make the government look exceptionally weak, and radical elements within the country may see it as an oppertunity to strike, but can we really afford a war with the Hungarians at this stage?"
hun.21.a: "We cannot afford a war."
hun.21.b: "Not an inch of ground will be given!"
###
hun.22.t: "Slovakia concedes to our demands"
hun.22.d: "In a farsighted move, the Slovak government has given in to our rightful reclaimation of Southern Slovakia."
hun.22.a: "Wonderful!"
###
hun.23.t: "The Slovaks are defiant!"
hun.23.d: "It seems that nationalist intransigence wins again for the agitators of the Danubian Plain, with the Slovaks refusing to submit to our request. Already, the general staff is preparing our armies for the destruction of this irresponsible state!"
hun.23.a: "Then they shall fall."
###
hun.24.t: "Hungary demands complete submission"
hun.24.d: "The Hungarians have always claimed our free people and nation as theirs due to wishful thinking and a blind faith in their supposed \"historical\" rights. Even though we have already granted them territorial concessions, they now threaten war unless we return to the Magyar fold - a notion unthinkable to all but the most cowardly!"
hun.24.a: "We must surrender..."
hun.24.b: "Not one step back!"
###
hun.25.t: "Slovakia cedes to our demands"
hun.25.d: "It seems that the Slovaks have opted to see reason and return to the Hungarian realm. Already, some are suggesting that we reward their submission with some autonomy while others urge for no compromise in their assimilation into the Hungarian way of life - although these conversations have for now not been concluded."
hun.25.a: "Hungariandom sees yet another great victory!"
###
hun.26.t: "Slovakia stands defiant!"
hun.26.d: "The Slovaks have always been especially stubborn in seeing the truth, but their response to our demand yet again proves what sort of people they are. In response to our request for their return to the realm, the Slovaks have cut all diplomatic ties and seem now to be marshalling for war!"
hun.26.a: "We will crush them in a few days."
###
hun.27.t: "Additional Volunteers arrive from Romania!"
hun.27.d: "It seems our message is reaching a wider audience across the border, more and more volunteers are crossing into Hungary by the day, and we are able to suppliment their relatively low numbers with our own soldiers. Soon we will have a force large enough to stand up to any foe who dares to oppose us."
hun.27.a: "Wonderful news!"
###
hun.28.t: "Operation Körömvirág"
hun.28.d: "Air Command has approached the Central Government with a request to launch an indepentant air raid on the Romanian capital of Bucharest. The war against Romania has reportedly begun to bog down around the Carpathian mountains and Air Command believes that carrying out a targeted raid on the capital of Romania will break their will to fight and force an early surrender."
hun.28.a: "Approve the operation."
hun.28.b: "Deny the operation."
###
hun.29.t: "Sándor Márai - A Night in Budapest"
hun.29.d: "Famed Hungarian writer and journalist Sándor Márai has announced today that he has finished his lifes work, a novel titled "A Night in Budapest" Sándor has already recieved critic acclaim from across Hungary for his excellent portrayal of Hungarian pride and nationalism in the form of an interesting and layered novel with complex characters and locations. \n\nThe novel begins in 1848, in the midst of the Hungarian Revolution and their attempt at leaving the iron grip of the Austrian Habsburgs. Following a string of military victories in Galicia and Bohemia, along with Prussian intervention on the side of the Hungarians, the Austrians are forced to recognize the independance of the Hungarian state as well as ceding authority over Dalmatia to Hungary. What followed shortly afterwards was a complete collapse of Habsburg authority over the remaining Cisleithanian lands, as regional warlords attempted to carve their own states out of the collapsing empire. \n\nIn 1908, a diplomatic crisis occurs in Bosnia when Hungary sends soldiers into the territory under the pretense of quelling the unrest, but ends up annexing the lands into the Hungarian crown, to the objection of Russia, France, and the weakened Ottoman Empire. The following conflict ended up spanning four continents and six years as Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania tears itself apart under two alliance blocs. The war ends in a Hungarian-Prussian-British victory, but at a very high cost to all nations. The novel ends with the Hungarian and Prussian kingdoms on the brink of revolution, and the British empire struggling to maintain its overextedned empire in an age of guns, germs, and steel. \n\n[HUN.GetLeader] has praised Sándor for his work, and is considering making the novel a national treasure. This novel will not be soon forgotten, and there are even rumors of it being turned into a board game under the Swedish game developers "Contradiction Interactive"."
hun.29.a: "What a read!"
###
hun.30.t: "The Foundation of the Slovak People's Army?"
hun.30.d: "With our conquest of Slovakia now complete, many generals have suggested the formation of a battlegroup made up entirely of Slovak 'volunteers' in order to integrate them with the Hungarian army and beign the process of assimilating the Slovak people into the Hungarian culture once more. \n\nWhile there are obvious benifits to enacting this decision, many who served in the k.u.k. army during the Great War are quick to point out the Czechoslovak betrayal and their feeble attempt at carving a nation-state out of Hungarian lands. These men believe that arming the Slovaks will only incite unrest and lead to an armed revolt led by Slovak patriots. However, we may very well need these men in the war against Romania, and every single gun counts on the field of battle..."
hun.30.a: "A phenomenal idea!"
hun.30.b: "Arming the Slovaks will only bring us trouble."
###
hun.31.t: "Hungarian citizen murdered in Szolnok"
hun.31.d: "Several nights ago in the city of Szolnok, a young Hungarian boy by the name of János Téli was found dead and dismembered in the ditch next to the house of one of the butchers living in the city. Many citizens are accusing the butcher of killing the boy, but no solid evidence has come up against him. \n\nSeveral anti-semetic groups in the city are placing the blame on the small Jewish population living within its borders, claiming it was a 'ritual killing' and was planned far in advance. These anti-semetic groups are inciting violence against the Jewish population and there have already been several incidents of targeted attacks against shops and homes owned and inhabited by Jews. The mayor claims the violence will subside and the local police can deal with the situation, but we should keep a close eye on the city in case it escalates."
hun.31.a: "How Tragic!"
###
hun.32.t: "Anti-semetic violence spreads"
hun.32.d: "Despite what the mayor said, the violence directed against the Jewish population of Eastern Hungary has spread throughout the city and the local synagogue has been attacked numerous times by angry mobs hoping to tear it down. Several Jewish butchers are suspected of partaking in the murder, including Jordánia Kovács, the main suspect in the investigation. The city is requesting that a small regiment be sent in to take control of the city and restore order."
hun.32.a: "Concerning..."
###
hun.33.t: "Order Restored?"
hun.33.d: "With the Arrow-Cross movement having been dealt a decisive, crippling blow by the recent fighting, it has begun to collapse under its own weight with many of the members jumping ship as counterrevolution appears poised to rule the day. With Szálasi having fled in the chaos and the position of president now empty, Imrédy has readied himself to put in the position one Jenő Rátz, a conservative general with close ties and sympathies to Imrédy.\n\nThis however has been viciously opposed by the conservative opposition. While many vastly prefer Imrédy to someone like Szálasi, their opposition does not merely end at a popular type of Hungarian valkism. For many, Imrédy actively enabled the rise of Szálasi and in any case, his rise would likely mean a wholesale end of not just the republic, but any form of freedom in Hungary. They have instead nominated their leader, István Bethlen, to be the new president of Hungary, after which new, although strictly conservative elections can be held.\n\nFor Imrédy, such a notion is laughable - new elections would simply mean the return of Szálasi’s rabble! With Imrédy unwilling to give up his nomination, it seems both Imrédy and Bethlen are now on collision course with one another - the outcome to be determined by who the army supports. Imrédy certainly has many in the Honvédség who he can rely on, although many are of a lower level. Meanwhile, Bethlen can count on the support of much of the upper echelons. Nevertheless, it will likely be the soldiers who will determine what comes next, with their view being that..."
hun.33.a: "We did not struggle just to return to the old ways!"
hun.33.b: "We must end Imrédy’s madness!"

hun.34.d: "With the return of some form of democracy to Hungary, many voters are eagerly looking forward to expressing themselves at the polls. From across the restored greater Hungary, the newly returned political parties have vigorously campaigned for popularity and support. While there are many who expect certain results, the only certainty is that on election day, this day of Hungarian democracy, the people have chosen..."

hun.35.t: "The New Apostolic King"
hun.35.d: "With the restoration of the monarchy and the liberation of greater Hungary, we can finally set about crowning prince Otto of Habsburg as king of Hungary and the Habsburg banner shall fly over Budapest once again!\n\nAt least, that is what the Legitimists have to say about the matter. There are many who oppose them, whether out of political concerns as legitimists often jockey for political influence in the rest of the nation or ideological opposition to a Habsburg return. While the Habsburgs were quite popular among the population, the liberation of greater Hungary not through the ancient dynasty but rather through the Hungarian will has caused the ‘free-electors’, a group who believe that the old Pragmatic Sanction should be disregarded in choosing a new Hungarian king, to gain massive popularity and influence. For their part, they have come together and instead nominated Albrecht Franz of Habsburg-Teschen, who is noted for his many nationalist exploits and his claim to being the duke of Teschen. Albrect Franz has been especially renowned due to his mother’s leveraging of the vast sums donated to the government, putting us in a difficult spot to say the least."

hun.42.d: "With the arrival of a new year, the already tense state of relations in the national coalition yet again seems ready to burst at the seams. Both president Szálasi and prime minister Imrédy are of different attitudes and vision. Both lead different parties and ultimately have a different vision of the Hungary to come. Still, they agree on one thing - the revision of that wretched treaty - the humiliation of Trianon.\n\nWith the old Hungarian nation beset on all sides and only a nominally rising counter in Germany, the national government must be ready to mobilize Hungary for the grand struggle - for the rebirth of Greater Hungary and the restoration of Magyar pride. As this goes on however, both the Arrow Cross and MMP will be sure to fight each other at every step of the way."

hun.43.d: "Even as the economy continues to recover following the Great Depression, the financial and economic situation remains precarious. Although few can criticize the efforts of our government, the coalition’s greatest tension has arisen from the clash between the ultraconservative economics of prime minister Imrédy and the revolutionary and often extremely statist plans of president Szálasi.\n\nThe critics of liberal democracy’s folly have now been vindicated furthermore, with the collapse of the London Stock Market and a dive into economic recession for nearly all countries. Unfortunately for us, we have been hit by the crash as well, which now threatens not just our legitimacy, but the unity of the coalition to restore Hungary’s wholeness."

We have been struggling against this crash with all our might, and the results have been satisfactory. For while we have yet to escape the vicious grip of economic depression, the Hungarian economy is healing through the measures we have enacted - making the future a bit brighter at a time."

hun.45.d: "Today is a proud day, a day that all Hungarians will forever remember. Through struggle and hardship, against all odds, Greater Hungary has been restored and Trianon repudiated. With the liberals laid low and Hungary now ascendant in the Balkans, the popularity of the government has risen wildly with ecstatic cheers for the Arrow-Cross movement and for the Szeged leaders.\n\nBut this masks the reality of the situation. Tensions between the two movements have been long simmering, and there is little doubt that the already tense coalition of Szeged and Szálasi will be able to withstand the storm for much longer. As things begin to come to a head, the question of Hungary’s future still lies in the balance. Nevertheless, both sides of the coalition have only one mood now - unrestrained celebration."
hun.45.a: "Nem! Nem! Soha!"
### valkism?
hun.46.t: "The Valkist Turn?"
hun.46.d: "With prime minister Béla Imrédy now securely at the helm of the nation, we can set about righting the wrongs inflicted upon the Hungarian gentlemen from Jews and the proletarian Arrow Cross. In this venture, few have been as successful as the Germans. Inspired by the brilliant leader Adam Dressler, the new Valkist Germany is one to take great inspiration from even in spite of their more local tendencies towards anti-Catholicism and revolutionary action.\n\nImrédy has preempted this question by preparing an entire plan that would see the new Hungarian nation embrace the zeitgeist. With a Valkist constitution prepared that would legalistically and mercilessly deal with Hungary’s enemies and with our recent alliance with Berlin, Imrédy now only has to decide if we are to at last implement this next step in the resurrection of Hungary."
hun.46.a: "It is time to follow the German lead."
hun.46.b: "Never! This does not befit the Hungarian spirit."
### start of events...
hun.47.t: "The End of the Republic"
hun.47.d_start: "With the restoration of greater Hungary, the republic and its French-designed institutions are no longer necessary. So decreed president Ferenc Szálasi, who together with the Arrow-Cross parliamentary bloc pushed for not only the permanent suspension of any elections, but who have also drawn up a new constitutional plan to be implemented at the first opportunity. In this new plan, all parties were to subordinate themselves to the Party of National Will, which was to reform itself into the Front of National Will - Szálasi would obviously have absolute power.\n\n"
hun.47.d: "$hun.46.d_start$This has not gone over well with the rest of the parliament, whether they be the rump opposition relegated to obscurity and protected only by merciful aristocrats or the other members of the national coalition. With their united opposition to this, the republic’s institutions will hold, although this has already sparked fury on the Arrow-Cross side. It seems that the fate of the national coalition is up in the air."
hun.47.d_arrow_cross: "$hun.46.d_start$With a tight grip on power, the Arrow-Cross deputies need not even negotiate certain terms. With the agreement, or rather coercion of the many National Socialist splinters as well as the Revival Party, the consecration of the Hungarist movement in the government has been done. The republic is no more."
hun.47.a: "Or so we thought..."
hun.47.b: "It will not be missed."
### arrow cross
hun.48.t: "New Order in Budapest"
hun.48.d: "The Hungarist vision has always been under threat by opportunists and reactionaries. While they gloat about false glories, the peasants and workers who truly make the Hungarian nation turn suffer under their yoke - benefitting only Jews and other malcontents. With our great reclamation however, the Nemzetvezető’s vision has finally won. With the German traitors reeling in popularity and the Arrow-Cross movement stronger than ever before, the time has come.\n\nAddressing the nation today, Szálasi has declared the position of president and prime minister to finally be one and the same. No more shall politicians of the aristocratic mold impede the Hungarist vision, for Szálasi too has called for the creation of a broad, but pure Arrow-Cross front with all parties to either cooperate or to be dissolved. Despite initial furious protest by Imrédy, he soon realized the hopelessness of the situation. Tendering his retirement from political life, the last roadblock to the unfiltered Hungarist vision has been removed."
hun.48.a: "None shall threaten the Hungarist vision!"
### split!
hun.49.t: "Split in the Coalition"
hun.49.d: "Once allies in the struggle for Hungarian resurrection, the national coalition’s future is now certain. With tensions over every policy matter including even foreign policy, the Party of National Will and Hungarian Revival Party have broken off their mutual coalition. While Imrédy remains prime minister, the reality is that the Hungarian government is now in total disfunction.\n\nFew expect this to be for long however. Both sides have awaited the day where the usefulness of the other would end. Both Arrow-Cross and Imrédists have armed and readied themselves for a battle not just with words, but with bullets. Rallying loyal supporters from the countryside and urban factories, the Greenshirts have swelled in size with many in the newly liberated territories too arming themselves for the new Hungarist future. Meanwhile, Imrédy has rallied the aristocrats led by István Bethlen, with soldiers returning home from the recent wars of liberation now readying themselves to crack down on the ‘green-Bolsheviks’ of Szálasi. The fate of Hungary now lies in the balance."
hun.49.a: "Awful!"
hun.49.tt: "If the existing balance of power leans towards one side by more than 40%, they will be guaranteed to come out victorious in the coming split"
### MMP
hun.50.t: "Coup in Budapest"
hun.50.d: "While president Szálasi has always been more of a visionary than a practical politician, this has not resulted in a positive outcome for his movement. Far from entrenching themselves into power, the Arrow-Cross movement has been slowly supplanted by radical officers and middle-class aristocrats of the MMP. With Imrédy now more powerful than ever, it seems that he has decided that the Arrow-Cross movement has outlived its usefulness.\n\nTogether with defence minister Jenő Ratz and general Döme Sztójay, they hatched a plot to unseat the Arrow-Cross rabble. At a meeting of the cabinet, Imrédy made a scene by suggesting Szálasi to step down following his presiding over the great triumph of Hungary’s reclamation. Defiant and utterly indignant at this prospect, Szálasi would make clear in no uncertain terms that Imrédy was to either fall into the Arrow-Cross line or he would be made to resign.\n\nWith news of this conflict spreading like wildfire, the generals of the Honvédség would spring into action. Under the pretense of finally protecting the nation from further Arrow-Cross terror, army units would march into Budapest, apprehending the Arrow-Cross’s top leaders. With all levels of the bureaucracy in the firm hands of Imrédy, a mass crackdown on the Arrow-Cross has commenced. With president Szálasi now removed, general Jenő Ratz has been made president though few are fooled by his appointment.\n\nAll of Hungary now lies in the hands of Béla Imrédy."
hun.50.a: "The pseudo-Bolsheviks have finally been removed..."
### showdown!!!
hun.51.t: "Showdown on the Danube"
hun.51.d: "Few could have expected the coalition of the far-right could possibly last so long as it did, yet now there is no illusion as to its fate. With both the MMP and NAP now actively butting heads with one another, it is clear that only one movement is big enough to lead the Hungarian nation on to greater glories.\n\nWith president Szálasi unwilling to entertain any notion of stepping down, the only recourse has been violence on the street. After yet another failed attempt at compromise, Szálasi had enough. Calling on the Greenshirts to smash the reactionaries, wild violence on the streets would soon begin.\n\nFor their part, Imrédy’s allies have prepared themselves - calling for the army to crush the Arrow Cross movement wherever they may find it. Calling on the Greenshirts to fight back, Arrow-Cross men and police would begin to fight in the streets. As conflict began to engulf the whole nation, the Imrédists rallied in Szeged, home of the old counterrevolution.\n\nWith Budapest and Szeged embroiled in chaos and fighting, it seemed that civil war might very well engulf the whole nation. Yet as day turned to night and a new dawn rose over Hungary, the fighting had ceased. Life seemed ready to return to normal - at least as normal as it was beforehand. There was but only one change.\n\nIn the fighting, the Hungarian people had made their choice, the future that the Magyar state would tread. They decided, in the streets, fields and mines of the newly restored Hungary, that..."
hun.51.a: "The Hungarian people shall no longer suffer as wretched slaves!"
hun.51.b: "Out with the rabble - God save Hungary!"
