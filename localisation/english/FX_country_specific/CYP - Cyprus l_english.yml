# Events
cyp.1.t: "Cypriots demand autonomy!"
cyp.1.d: "In the wake of the recent London Stock Market Crash, the people of Cyprus have seized an opportunity to press for greater autonomy, a cause they have championed for a considerable period. While their demand for autonomy had been voiced before, the economic turmoil stemming from the crash left them in a unique position. However, a significant obstacle now stands in their way: the erosion of their armed forces' capabilities, rendering them powerless in their pursuit of greater self-governance. As a result, the Cypriots find themselves in a precarious situation, seemingly compelled to accept the current state of affairs."
cyp.1.a: "We can do nothing, give them some autonomy."
