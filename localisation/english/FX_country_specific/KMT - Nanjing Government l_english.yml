Fanning out from their bases past friendly lines, they fancy themselves as \"anonymous heroes\" who will not be remembered by history except for their revolution's ultimate triumph. Most of their senior leadership stem from a clique of Whampoa graduates known as the \"League of Ten\", an ultranationalistic group with ties to organised crime. Still, it would be unwise to dismiss them as mere gangsters - they have been known to seek associates (willing and otherwise) high and low, ranging from Catholic Cardinals to opera singers to high society playboys. Although not a direct threat, the growing reach of the ZhongTeJu should not be taken lightly.§!"

In order to better integrate Guangdong's sister province and prevent the return of banditry and corruption, a railway connecting Guilin and Nanning will be built."
KMT_guilin_changsha_railway: "Build the Guilin-Changsha Railway"
KMT_guilin_changsha_railway_desc: "The Guilin-Changsha Line is the most important railway in the south, connecting the economic capital of the south with the distant Beijing.

KMT_address_the_nation: "Address the Nation"
KMT_address_the_nation_desc: "A special session of the Kuomintang Cabinet has been planned, and it is expected that the gathered politicians will present a plethora of reforms to the table - reforms that are likely intended to put more power in their hands, and perhaps even open up positions on the council to those outside the aristocracy. It is a bold plan, though some are nervous as to whether the Chiang will agree."
KMT_assume_complete_control: "Assume Complete Control"
KMT_assume_complete_control_desc: "In the National Revolution's darkest hour, it was the Generalissimo and his leadership of the Party that managed to save the party and the nation from destruction from anti-revolutionaries. Salvation for China today can be attained only through selflessly organising and obeying the lingxiu, trusting the policies of the Generalissimo, and implementing his orders. When we are of one mind, we become one body... there is no other way."
KMT_imprison_the_opposition: "Imprison the Opposition"
KMT_imprison_the_opposition_desc: "As was expected, many among the political elite resent our recent policies. Our most vocal opponents, even those whose work we once promised to secure, should be imprisoned."

Nonetheless, an organic law shall be passed to govern in a constitution's stead, ushering in the return of a formal Executive Yuan."

KMT_authorize_special_services: "The \"Special Services\" Bureau"
KMT_authorize_special_services_desc: "Revolutions are often a dance between dreams and nightmares. Beneath all the high-minded convictions the party holds, there is often a need for \"special services\" to \"handle\" challenges that crop up over the course of China's transformation. Grim though it may be, we must do what is necessary to win - even if it means holding our nose and closing our eyes. Some battles must be fought in the dark."
KMT_authorize_special_services_tt: "The Government's §YZhongTeJu§! headed by Dai Li will be created.\n"
KMT_maintain_democratic_legitimacy: "Maintain Democratic Legitimacy"
KMT_maintain_democratic_legitimacy_desc: "While parliamentary democracy is certainly vile and creates factionalism (which in turn leads to unproductivity and a stagnant state), we should truly strive to realise Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People and his calls for life, liberty, and equality. However, these qualities of democracy cannot be totally achieved until the on-going emergency is resolved. The suspended Legislative Yuan will be allowed to reconvene but under vigilant watch as we \"perfect\" Sun's vision."

KMT_the_three_principles_of_the_people_desc: "The Kuomintang, as part of the National Revolution, prioritises the Mass Movement as it sees the masses as the fundamental revolutionary vanguard and that the revolution for the Chinese people must be led by the people. In order to encourage the masses to fight for the revolution and to realise Dr. Sun's Three Principles' of the People, let us reach out to the masses and work on short-term projects such as rent-reduction campaigns in regions that we have conquered"
KMT_sun_yat_sen_legacy: "The Father's Legacy"
KMT_sun_yat_sen_legacy_desc: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen called for a revolution for all people, quanmin geming - and that the National Revolution was for all people in China not just the peasants and workers. Long has our party been separated by petty internal factionalism but with the help of General Chiang's leadership, it is not a Reorganisation but rather a Reconstruction of the Party that we seek. Forward, we march towards a bright new White dawn of democracy and civil rights - let us finally realise the dream of dear late leader, and seek to inspire the rest of the East to follow our example."

KMT_farm_mechanization_programs_desc: "There's no doubt that the farming industry is one of the biggest in our nation. The current agricultural techniques used however leave a lot to be desired.

KMT_subsidize_new_industries_desc: "Unlike the other major cliques in China, the region of Guangdong remains quite profitable as a result of foreign trade and its proximity to the sea and to Hong Kong.

KMT_synthetic_fuel_project_desc: "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world.

KMT_women_in_the_workforce: "Women in the Workforce"

KMT_the_chinese_air_force_desc: "While initial air operations began with the Qing Dynasty's Beijing Nanyuan airfield - the Kuomintang's Republic of China Air Force owes its origins to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Bureau of Aeronautics under the Guangzhou Military Government.

KMT_fighter_modernization: "Fighter Modernization"
KMT_fighter_modernization_desc: "With the creation of our own native air industries, let us pursue the production of our own domestic fighters such as the Chu (AFAMF) XP-0. This monoplane will be able to serve dual purposes as both a fighter and a dive bomber in the skies."
KMT_bomber_modernization: "Bomber Modernization"
KMT_bomber_modernization_desc: "As the conflicts around the world showed us, modern wars are also won by intense bombing campaigns to target enemy industrial complexes and military apparatuses.

KMT_expand_airbases: "Expand Airbases"

KMT_the_chinese_navy: "Guard Our Seas"
KMT_the_chinese_navy_desc: "The Navy has ailed over the last few decades, forced to play a subservient role: a secondary priority compared to the army, an auxiliary force for foreign concessionists, and a money pit for our treasury. No more. If China is to be truly free, it must have a navy capable of defending its shores and protecting its trade. The first step is to create an independent command capable of overseeing its revival."
KMT_grand_fleet: "Grand Fleet"
KMT_grand_fleet_desc: "It is not enough for us to be satisfied with petty gunboats and outdated cruisers. A real fleet requires capital ships, those capable of shredding apart enemy escorts and bombarding enemy fortifications.

We are living in the dawn of a new age in the Pacific, and may we be at the centre."
KMT_better_battleships: "Better Battleships"
KMT_better_battleships_desc: "Our administration has found a group of persons affiliated within the USN that is willing to let ship the designs being used to build their battleships. Although espionage is not this administration's strong suit, we can probably organise the payment for the designs."
KMT_wolfhounds_of_the_sea: "Wolfhounds of the Sea"
KMT_wolfhounds_of_the_sea_desc: "Beneath the surface in the darkest depths, intrepid men in deadly vessels lurk. Submarine warfare was in its infancy in the previous war, but has since become an equaliser between the haughty fleets of the status quo and the states that they oppress.

KMT_screen_research_project: "Screen Research Project"
KMT_screen_research_project_desc: "As part of our naval reform efforts, we should also seek to modernise our larger ships such as light cruisers. With China's massive industrial potential, there is no doubt that with time - we will be able to develop our own ambitious cruiser modernisation efforts and create a Republican Navy that can rival that of our greatest rivals."

The Fujian fleet has also sponsored large detachments of naval infantry. Together, they shall be the basis of a force capable of projecting abroad."
KMT_submarine_modernization: "Submarine Modernization"
KMT_submarine_modernization_desc: "If we are to wrest control of the Bohai Sea from our rivals, we must outwit their superior firepower at sea. The solution is a secretive submarine programme. The potential returns if we are able to dislodge this sea outweighs the cost of development."
# Chinese Army
KMT_the_chinese_army: "National Revolutionary Army"
KMT_the_chinese_army_desc: "In the same way that the Kuomintang is bringing progress to the nation, the National Revolutionary Army must be a vanguard for Chinese military development.

KMT_firepower_concentration: "Firepower Concentration"
KMT_firepower_concentration_desc: "If we are to avoid stalemates and the grinding sort of conflict that we can ill afford, we must take inspiration from the lessons learned in the trenches of the last major war. After careful scouting and planning, weak points in enemy lines must be assailed in one great, focused attack using modern combined arms. The widening breach will allow for breakthroughs to win us the day."
KMT_grand_battleplan: "Grand Battleplan"
KMT_grand_battleplan_desc: "We have ultimately settled on a doctrine of grand battleplans. Rather than waste lives, we will coordinate the entire war front so that our attacks arrive in perfect time and overwhelm the enemy with simultaneous well-planned assaults."
KMT_modern_logistics: "Modern Logistics"
KMT_modern_logistics_desc: "\"An army marches on its stomach\"\nA fact that our foreign advisors are quick to remind us of. If we are to sustain operations along a frontline as large as China, we cannot simply rely on ad-hoc supply chains or the generosity of the locals. Instead, a centralised, regularly monitored system of provisions must be created that will allow us to fight across long distances."
KMT_armor_research: "Armor Research"

KMT_army_motorization_desc: "Our army may possess the supplies, discipline, and fighting spirit that distinguishes a modern force - yet all this is useless if those supplies cannot reach the frontline, or if our brave men are gunned down because they are practically immobile against our more nimble enemies. The southern tradition of war, enhanced with modern technology, will make us unstoppable on campaign!"
KMT_signal_companies: "Signal Companies"
KMT_signal_companies_desc: "A major innovation used during the Great War in Europe was the radio, which tremendously expanded military communication as well as enhanced command and control in the battlefield. The use of radios is still in its infancy in China, but with some effort we can quickly augment our forces with this new technology - critical for coordinated, concentrated strikes in vulnerable enemy positions."
KMT_mechanized_experiments: "Mechanized Experiments"
KMT_mechanized_experiments_desc: "Some pragmatic compromises have to be made, even as we begin sweeping changes to our military structure. Du Yuming is a long-time WMARCA commander but has expressed willingness to lead in the creation of a mechanised force - proof that politics does not have to get in the way of professionalism. A mobile strike force for our revolutionary army will give us a key advantage over our warlord rivals."
KMT_expand_whampoa_academy: "Expand Whampoa Academy"
KMT_expand_whampoa_academy_desc: "In 1924, in accordance with the ideals of Sun Yat-sen, the Whampoa Military Academy was created to house China's next generation of officers and generals to partake in the national revolution. The Generalissimo and the Central Committee has unanimously agreed to authorise the expansion of the military academy in preparation for national unification."
KMT_the_general_staff: "The General Staff"
KMT_the_general_staff_desc: "In the insurgency period, command and control was an utter mess - left to the poorly coordinate initiative of various militia commanders.

#### Events
china.0.t: "The White Sun in the Blue Sky"
china.0.d: "The Kuomintang was born in Dr. Sun-Yat Sen's vision of a free Chinese republic, staging a revolution against the corrupt Qing Dynasty in 1911-1912 known as the Xinhai Revolution. However, the formidable forces of the Qing Dynasty outmanned the forces of the Kuomintang; desperate Sun and his political allies called the support of Yuan Shikai, asking him to betray the Qing Government in return for being made president of the new Chinese Republic. Yuan accepted Dr. Sun's deal, however after defeating the Qing Government, he made a desperate attempt to usher in a new Chinese dynasty with himself as first Emperor. In the years before this Yuan consolidated power within the Republic under himself by shuffling governors and assassinating political opponents, however almost immediately after declaring himself Emperor Yuan found himself completely devoid of allies and an entire nation opposed to him.\n\nSun and the rest of the Chinese Republic overthrew Yuan shortly before his natural death in 1916, but the damage to the Kuomintang had already been done, and the governors of the provinces that had revolted no longer accepted the weak authority that Sun had tried to impose upon China. This period between the end of the National Protection War and the Manchu Restoration can be largely described as the reasoning for the Beiyang Government taking such a hands-off approach to the provinces, and set the framework for the relationship between the national and sub-national governments. \n\nYears later Sun would return from exile and in 1921 form a military government in Guangdong, far from Beijing and as such the influence of the Beiyang Government, and in 1924 with the Beiyang Government reeling from a surprise attack from Fengtian and collapsing support of the provincial governors, Sun declared the beginning of the Northern Expedition in July 1924. However, Sun would die in 1925, and his death would lead to a deadly split in the Kuomintang between his two proteges, Chiang Kai-Shek and Wang Jingwei. Chiang ultimately won the power struggle, and proceeded to continue the Northern Expedition, which resulted initial successes for the Kuomitang forces but ultimately resulted in a stalemate between the three largest cliques in Chinese all claiming to be the legitimate government."

POLITICS_CHIANG_KAI_SHEK_DESC: "Born in 1887 in the province of Zhejiang, Chiang's early life was marked by hardship and struggle. However, his dedication to the cause of a united and strong China was unwavering. He was deeply influenced by the revolutionary fervor of the time, which ultimately led him to join the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT), and the fight against the oppressive Qing Dynasty.\n\nChiang's rise to prominence was meteoric. He displayed remarkable military acumen and leadership during the Northern Expedition, a campaign to reunify China under KMT rule. As the commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army, he skillfully navigated the complex political landscape, forging alliances and defeating warlords to achieve significant territorial gains.\n\nYet, his leadership was not without controversy. Critics pointed to his authoritarian tendencies and questioned his commitment to democratic ideals. Nevertheless, Chiang's unwavering dedication to China's sovereignty and his tireless efforts to resist Japanese expansionism earned him respect both domestically and internationally.\n\nAs the world stood on the brink of war, Chiang Kai-Shek stood as a beacon of hope for China. He believed that a strong, united, and modernized China could not only withstand the challenges of the era but also contribute to global peace. Little did we know that the coming years would test his resolve and the fate of China in ways none could have imagined."
