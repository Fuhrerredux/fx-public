### History
RHI_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The Rhineland is the industrial heart of Germany, and yet it now remains separated from that nation. Born out of the chaos and grief at the end of the Great War, the Rhineland mandate has seen better years. With Allied occupation dragging on seemingly permanently, indignation against the West has built up overwhelmingly with many desiring to return home to Germany.\n\nIn spite of that, a new hope for free Germany still lives on in the Rhineland. A Germany not dominated by tyrants, a Germany where every state and man can live freely. Whatever flag they fly, the people of the Rhineland will fight for their freedom."

# Parties
RHI_vanguardist_party: "PKfD"
RHI_vanguardist_party_long: "Proletarischer Kampfbund freies Deutschland (Proletarian Fighters' League for a Free Germany)\n§LFounded at the end of 1932 following Dressler’s rise to power, the Proletarian Fighter’s League currently serves as the muscle behind the KPD’s operations in the Rhineland. Initially violently striking at any non-socialist forces they deemed suitable, the PKfD has experienced rampant crackdowns at the hands of both local mandate forces as well as local German militias.\n\nFollowing the shift in line away from total opposition towards popular front strategies, the PKfD has in recent months toned down their viciously anti-mandate messaging, at times even seeming to avoid further conflict with the mandate forces. Nevertheless, these communist terrorists continue to stalk the Rhineland as a looming threat upon anyone who doesn’t seem to toe the revolutionary line - making their suppression a top priority to many.§!"

RHI_collectivist_party: "RGO"
RHI_collectivist_party_long: "Revolutionäre Gewerkschafts-Opposition (Revolutionary Union Opposition)\n§LFinding their origins in the most radical elements of the social democratic free trade unions, the Revolutionary Union Opposition would form across Germany at the tail end of 1928. With their inability to reconcile with the social democrat unions, the RGO would soon ally themselves with the communists, becoming the premier communist trade union in Germany.\n\nLacking much support amongst the employed working class and frequently barred from properly bargaining with employers by the government, the RGO would find themselves as one of the many leftist organizations crushed by Dressler following his 1932 takeover. Although the organization still exists in a noticeable capacity in the Rhineland, many expect the RGO to soon die out as anti-valkist unity becomes the chief aim of the communists.§!"

RHI_libertarian_socialist_party: "FAUR"
RHI_libertarian_socialist_party_long: "Freie Arbeiter Union Rheinlands (Free Workers' Union of the Rhineland)\n§LFounded at the end of 1919, the Free Workers’ Union of Germany would serve as the largest syndicalist organization in Germany in the republican era. Finding initial relative popularity in the Ruhr, the FAUD would find itself whittled away by infighting and defections, decreasing from its peak of hundreds of thousands to merely a few thousand by the time Dressler rose to power.\n\nBled by defections and crackdowns, this anarcho-syndicalist union has nevertheless stood the test of time - remaining in the Rhineland where they serve a minor role as an alternative to the dangerous RGO and reformist free unions still active in the Rhineland. Even so, many predict that the now-FAUR will not last another generation.§!"

RHI_social_democrat_party: "RU/Freiheitsfront"
RHI_social_democrat_party_long: "Rheinischer Unabhängigkeitsbund/Freiheitsfront (Rhenish Independence League/Freedom Front)\n§LAs the forerunner of the German socialist movements, the Social Democratic Party of Germany has seen better days in the Rhineland. Following the end of the Great War, the social democrats in the Rhine would find themselves ripped away from Germany, being forced to operate under the mandate government that represented all of Germany’s woes in the new world. Out of this chaos, a new organization would rise.\n\nFounded by the revolver journalist and professional rabble rouser Josef Friedrich Matthes, the Rhenish Independence League would begin to sweep up much of the working class that naturally supported the social democrats. Receiving hefty funds from Paris and even greater ire from Berlin, these separatists would soon begin to serve as the preferred separatist organization for the French - sick of Dorten’s ineptitude.\n\nFollowing Dressler’s rise to power in 1932, the Rhenish SPD would experience a great boon in membership, followed shortly by a brutal crackdown from French forces for their apparent intransigence. With their leaders fleeing to Prague and Kiel, the Rhenish SPD would collapse, reforming themselves into the much milder Freedom Front. Fundamentally built on opposing the Valkist menace at all cost, their comparatively cooperative tone towards the mandate has not endeared them to many with few foreseeing any kind of social democracy reaching the Rhineland in the years to come.§!"

In what appears now to be a calming storm, the lifting of the ban on the SPD has seen the social democrats return to the Rhine.

RHI_social_liberal_party: "MK"
RHI_social_liberal_party_long: "Mai-Klub (May Club)\n§LThe story of German liberalism is a long and painful one, more so with the lingering division of its adherents. The history of the April Club begins with the story of the Liberal Association. Founded in 1924 and its founding members having defected from the Democrats, the organization which was founded to ultimately end liberal splintering would ironically contribute to it with mutual hostility between it and the Democrats. In spite of initial successes, the association would soon find itself weakened until the 1928 elections, where it gained a new breath of life from the dismal results the liberal parties received, making liberal unity a pertinent goal.\n\nNonetheless, liberal unity was still not achieved. Losing the initial momentum gained following their electoral defeats, the organization would begin to stagnate and eventually become moribund. With circumstances in Germany turning for the worse, the liberal parties would soon find themselves also withering away in support - culminating in the takeover of Germany by Adam Dressler.\n\nFollowing this great shock, the remnants of the liberal parties would soon rally in the mandate. Initially beginning as local initiatives for liberal unity, these clubs formed after the republic’s demise would soon begin cooperation on a larger scale. Still suppressed under the mandate regime, many wonder if this is potentially the rebirth of German liberalism or merely the dying gasps of a doomed ideology.§!"

RHI_market_liberal_party: "DVP/RV/Bauerbund"
RHI_market_liberal_party_long: "Deutsche Volkspartei/Rheinische Volksvereinigung/Bund Freier Landwirte (German People’s Party/Rhenish People's Association/Free Agrarian League)\n§LThe Rhineland has always been home to a sizable and strong group of industrial magnates and bankers. With the heartland of German industry calling the banks of the mighty river home, it is no wonder that economic interest groups have always found their calling in Rhenish politics. With the rise of Dressler, several economic interest groups now jockey for influence in the suppressed political landscape.\n\nThe most ubiquitous yet controversial group is the remnants of the German People’s Party, home to many who fled the Green Terror that spread across Germany in 1932. Led by Eduard Dingeldey, the party struggles to keep itself going without the support of industrial interests, who fiercely combat the notion of any sort of liberal political unity and of the turning of the DVP into a middle-class party. As such, many feel the DVP of today will not live on to see the next government.\n\nReeling from the humiliating failure of 1924, the Rhenish People’s Association has barely bounced back. Scrounging what support it could from the middle-class and those alienated by Zentrum, the Volksvereinigung remains as one of the few potent forces in the separatist movement - though still ailing from Dorten’s questionable leadership.\n\nThe Rhineland too is not an entirely homogeneous industrial region, for many peasants find their living in the mandate, especially in the south. With the rise of Dressler, the many splintered agrarian groups have united into the Free Agrarian League, hoping to represent farmers’ interests against the interest of big industry.§!"

RHI_social_conservative_party: "Zentrum"
RHI_social_conservative_party_long: "Zentrumspartei (Centre Party)\n§LThere are few parties as historic in German politics as the Centre Party, especially in the Catholic Rhineland. Formed out of the Prussian-led Kulturkampf, Zentrum has served as a mainstay party in German politics, serving as a crucial centrist bulwark of the republic up until the fateful days of 1932. In the Catholic Rhineland, Zentrum was the premiere party for voters and for many in the Rhineland, the only hope to avoid further domination by the godless Valkist scourge to the east.\n\nHowever Zentrum did not live an uncontroversial life during the republican years, with the party many times nearly reaching the breaking point over the question of a cross-denominational party. Many conservatives were especially in favor of opening the party up to Protestants to form a new Christian People’s Party that would serve as a bulwark against socialism and other leftward elements as well as protect the interests of the Catholic working class.\n\nWith the fall of Germany to Valkism however, this question has fallen to the wayside with a more pressing one - should there be collaboration? While the mandate does not prohibit the activity of the party, the party’s hostility to continued occupation has netted it so far little more than further violence between occupier and occupied. While Weimar exiles clamour for resistance against imperialism, Rhenish locals see it differently - especially when it comes to choosing between the relative safety of French protection and the cruel tyrants of Berlin. Whatever future the Rhineland is to face, Zentrum is sure to meet it - ready or not.§!"

RHI_authoritarian_democrat_party: "IRKO"
RHI_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Interalliierten Rheinlandkommission (Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission)\n§LWhat have decades of occupation resulted in? Economic disarray, political strife and social upheaval among other malaises befalls the mandate, once a shining beacon as the frontier of democracy.\n\nFormed at the end of the Great War, the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission has acted as the main governing body in the Rhineland ever since the end of the Great War. Representing British, American, Belgian and most especially French interests in the area, its existence was never going to be easy. With delegates and their armies enforcing the occupation of the area, countless battles have been waged verbally as well as with pen and paper between the former allies, especially over the fate of the region as a whole.\n\nForced into yet another crisis following the rise of Dressler in 1932, many are certain that the mandate may very well not last into the next year or year after that. Floating on a house of cards where Lebel-wielding separatists duel with Mauser-armed nationalists in the streets, another crisis will likely spell doom for this antiquated administration.§!"

RHI_paternal_autocrat_party: "VGS"
RHI_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Vereinigung Graf Schlieffen - Landesverband Rheinland(Graf Schlieffen Society - Rhenish Regional Association)\n§LOn the face of it, it appears that the Graf Schlieffen Society is just your typical veteran officers’ association. As with all such societies in Germany, one may too suspect that many of the members are staunch Valkists.\n\nPeculiarly, this is not the case for the Rhenish branch, the cause of which being one man whose machinations and dealings have greatly affected the recent history of Germany - Kurt von Schleicher.\n\nFollowing the failed putsch against Dressler in 1932, Schleicher would find himself in deep trouble. With a noose being readied for him especially, Schleicher would flee along with his entourage to the Rhenish mandate, joining up with anti-Valkist officers at all levels to form a new Graf Schlieffen Society.\n\nWhile the mandate may believe that this society is a benign gathering of old men commiserating, the reality is starkly different. Pumping out droves of anti-Valkist horror stories and pamphlets, the society has become a vehicle for the aging Schleicher to regain his power and to see Germany out of the crisis that she is in. The crisis of 1932 never ended - for as long as thugs reign in Berlin, the scions of old Germany shall not give up.§!"

RHI_national_populist_party: "DRVP"
RHI_national_populist_party_long: "Deutsche-Rheinische Volkspartei (German Rhenish People's Party)\n§LThe mandate has brought about many horrors, real or imagined, onto the German population. Whether it is through real cases of brutality against civilians by increasingly disgruntled occupiers, or sensationalized behavior on their parts, few Germans feel any affinity to the mandate administration. Out of the many who oppose the mandate however are a few who do not just oppose foreign occupation, but even republican government.\n\nThe German-Rhenish People’s Party can not truly be described as a regular party in the typical sense, with its real purpose being to channel pan-German sentiments into political action. As the successor to a long line of prohibited pan-German parties, the DRVP now exists as the main vehicle for non-Valkist, anti-republican force in the Rhineland, though it has often incurred much displeasure from Berlin as a result of its more traditionally völkisch orientation.§!"

RHI_valkist_party: "VVBR"
RHI_valkist_party_long: "Vaterländischer Valkistischer Bund Rheinland (Valkist Fatherland's League of the Rhineland)\n§LThe German dream has never faltered in the Rhineland, but it has changed. Once the domain of firm nationalist republicans and foes of the Weimar state, the anti-mandate movement has taken a new, darker form.\n\nFounded by Albert Leo Schlageter, the Valkist Fatherland’s League has become the main vehicle opposed to the continued rule of the Rhineland mandate. Closely tied to the original Front Fighters’ Bloc in Germany, the Rhenish valkists partake in terrorist activity comparable only to the most radical communists. In spite of harsh crackdowns by the mandate however, Valkist forces still continue to stalk the Rhineland and many fear that the end of the mandate may well behold the rise of Valkism. Nevertheless, their popular support is in many ways minimal and their seizure of power may herald something darker on the Rhineland’s horizon.§!"

The electrification of rural towns will take a while longer, as movement of coal along the Rhine is the easiest way to maintain a steady supply of fuel."

RHI_expand_resource_extractions: "Expand Resource Extraction"
RHI_expand_resource_extractions_desc: "Prosperity of the Rhine-Ruhr area stems from its large navigable river in combination with rich ore and coal deposits nearby. It is only logical to give expanded funding to prospecting companies surveying new potential veins, and cheap mining rights to RWE and Thyssen-Krupp."

RHI_support_local_manfacturing_businesses: "Support Local Manufacturers"
RHI_support_local_manfacturing_businesses_desc: "Professions like engineers, wheelwrights, woodworkers, soapers or millers make up the industrial foundation of our economy. The recently flourishing ‘Mittelstand’ has emboldened a whole new class of workers. No longer having to share bunk beds with colleagues, but being able to afford a full family home by the power of their own labour is the new trend."

RHI_social_security_programme: "Create Social Security"
RHI_social_security_programme_desc: "A social security system can provide a greater wealth of economic security and growth for the individual and the state respectively. As such, creating the National Social Security Organization is a top priority if we wish to make the people happy and the numbers go up."

RHI_print_rhenishe_mark: "The Rhenish Mark"
RHI_print_rhenishe_mark_desc: "if we are to assert our financial independence from Paris and London, we’ll need a new currency, one backed by a central bank. "

RHI_nationalize_coal_industry: "Protect our Coal"
RHI_nationalize_coal_industry_desc: "The French originally occupied the Saarland for one factor: coal. Coal is a lacking material in the French industry, and it showed during the Great War that the French war machine relies heavily on coal. Be it for trains, heating or for production of materials. Nationalisation of the coal mines is a topic of debate, however, we must make sure the Rhineland comes first. We need to send a message to the French, that even while allies, they still have to pay as foreigners."

RHI_support_local_arms_manfacturing: "Build up our Armaments"
RHI_support_local_arms_manfacturing_desc: "In the event that we are brought into mass conflict it is crucial that we have enough weapon stocks in order to give every man a gun and every division dozens of trucks. As such we should encourage our military industry to begin ramping up production by building new factories as assisting them in their research."

RHI_use_kaiserreich_knowledge: "Employ Exiled Experts"
RHI_use_kaiserreich_knowledge_desc: "Although the Rhineland is a land of ingenuity and innovation, we still lack much of the experienced manpower to make our research capabilities truly equal to what it ought to be. However, our position as one of the free German states has granted us the opportunity to make use of the vital know-how that have fled for a freer country, thereby improving our technological limits."

RHI_build_the_schnellstrassen: "Build the Schnellstraßen"
RHI_build_the_schnellstrassen_desc: "Projects like the ‘Autobahn’ over in Valkist Germany have gathered great envy from our politicians and people alike. It is time we empower the motorists of the Rhine to the same level as our brothers to the east. The ministry of transportation has put forward the ‘Schnellstraßen Gesetz’ to counter this disparity. Two routes from north to south and three from east to west will place our highways to be the linchpin between eastern and western Europe."

RHI_christian_socialism: "Reject Inhumane Capitalism"
RHI_christian_socialism_desc: "Capitalism has brought many nations from an agrarian feudal society to one of modernity and industrialism. However far too often does this hurt those with the least to lose, focusing on exploiting the individual for all his worth and then throwing him away, like scrapes off a plate. We are above this barbarism, we will not play the role of ruthless oppressor, instead, we will play the role of the caretaker of the people."

RHI_social_market_economy: "The Social Market Economy"
RHI_social_market_economy_desc: "Rejecting inhumane capitalism means turning rheinish capitalism towards the people's needs. The government's job will be to steer the free market to benefit the wealth of everybody. The creation of a welfare state and the strengthening of middle class businesses will be our top priorities."

RHI_establish_the_betriebsrat: "Form the Betriebsrat"
RHI_establish_the_betriebsrat_desc: "To better address the direct needs of employees, we will mandate companies to form councils managing their human resources. These Betriebsräte’ will be democratically elected inside the companies and represent the workforce when negotiating with the employers. Unlike unions, these bodies are far more fragmented, not being able to strike the whole country, but with just enough direct action to satisfy the proletariat."

RHI_establish_central_bank: "Start a Central Bank"
RHI_establish_central_bank_desc: "Establishing a central bank is crucial for maintaining economic stability and fostering sustainable growth by providing a stable currency and efficient payment systems; a central bank will boost confidence among investors and the public, essential for economic prosperity. Its role in safeguarding economic stability is indispensable for our national growth and prosperity"

RHI_look_towards_britain_and_lowlands: "Our Northern Neighbours"
RHI_look_towards_britain_and_lowlands_desc: "Out of all the nations in Europe, Great Britain is by far the strongest of them all. Further proof of that is through the Benelux countries, they were able to have a healthy relationship with the island. We could start a new relationship with Great Britain to aid us in our plight, especially as a democratic country."

RHI_negotiate_with_american_investors: "Negotiate with Wall Street"
RHI_negotiate_with_american_investors_desc: "Wall Street is home to the world’s greatest stock exchange center. This could prove a boon to our state, especially when the Americans are interested in a democratic nation like us. It’s time we call upon the greatest republic in the western hemisphere to aid us as the frontier of democracy."

RHI_negotiate_british_arms_deal: "Enlist British Aid"
RHI_negotiate_british_arms_deal_desc: "The French aren’t the only ones who can help us in rebuilding our nation. Great Britain can help us in many ways; construction, trade deals, and the most important one, arms manufacturing. They are second to none when it comes to creating machines of war. If we’re able to get in their good graces, then we’ll be able to build up our war machine with them."

RHI_clear_workers_slums: "Clear Out Slums"
RHI_clear_workers_slums_desc: "The slums are not houses. They are poorly constructed to the point that it doesn’t bring the true comforts of a home. Let us clear these huts and give reparations to the workers so they may be able to have a better roof to live under."

RHI_modernize_rural_areas: "Modernize the Countryside"
RHI_modernize_rural_areas_desc: "Due to the allure of the cities, our humble countryside is being neglected by the younger generation. If we can show them that their humble abodes can be restored, they will see that their homes are the nation’s breadbaskets."

RHI_continue_french_economic_intergration: "The Sensible Choice"
RHI_continue_french_economic_intergration_desc: "It would be foolish if we stopped continuing France’s help towards us. We have decided to renew our economic treaty with them and ensure the prosperity of our Rhineland."

RHI_renegotiate_coal_shipments: "Revise Coal Shipments"
RHI_renegotiate_coal_shipments_desc: "The Rhineland is known to be rich in coal deposits for decades, and has seen moderate exploitation by the German Empire. Since the defeat in the great war however, mining and surveying efforts have come to a halt. In essence, allied occupation has forbidden coal exports to Germany, which in turn dried up investment. If we could instead negotiate a trade deal with France and the low countries, our ‘Braunkohlerevier’ is sure to balance the current trade deficit, and generate employment."

RHI_franco_rheinish_economic_union: "Strengthen Mutual Cooperation"
RHI_franco_rheinish_economic_union_desc: "Furthering economic cooperation is the only way we will truly recover from Black Wednesday. Paris needs coal and steel, we need investments. Our two states must rise together."

RHI_begin_austerity_programmes: "Begin Austerity"
RHI_begin_austerity_programmes_desc: "The London crash hit our economy especially hard, as British investors more or less withdrew from our economy. We will need to balance the budget in order to get by. "

RHI_stop_state_investment: "End State Investments"
RHI_stop_state_investment_desc: "If we are to balance our budget, drastic measures have to be taken. Government ministers have been briefed to identify unnecessary investments and cut their funding. Almost every sector will be scrutinised and reduced to the bare minimum to keep the state running. Infrastructure, education, R&D, housing and the military will be hit the hardest, probably resulting in a spike of unemployment. In the short term this will lead to financial manoeuvrability for our cabinet, but may lead to unforeseen structural deficits for years to come."

RHI_begin_rationing_supplies: "Begin Rationing"
RHI_begin_rationing_supplies_desc: "In the event of war, it's safe to assume food supplies will need to be preserved, and more importantly, distributed in rations. We shouldn’t wait for when the war starts, we should make it a base preparation for the military. We never know when the enemy will strike, so we need to make sure that our soldiers, and people, are fed. Even if only by a bit."

RHI_court_auction_failling_assets: "Court Failing Assets"
RHI_court_auction_failling_assets_desc: "Many government programs have seen little growth in usage and profitability over the past few years. These non essential costs are a sure way to free up cash, by simply being auctioned off into the hands of the free market. Services like public transportation and waste management, but also state owned farms and power plants that have been stagnant already before the stock market crash are attractive ways for large companies to diversify. Mostly because we are selling out at a fraction of the actual worth."

RHI_begin_public_work_intiatives: "Begin Public Works"
RHI_begin_public_work_intiatives_desc: "Our public services are in a bad shape. The investment-stop after the outbreak of the great war and negligence afterwards let schools, town halls, recreational facilities and public transportation fall into a state of disrepair. All of these sectors yearn for renewal, and if we are to keep the state functioning in the long term, huge investments are non-negotiable."

RHI_fund_infrastructure: "Connect the Rhine"
RHI_fund_infrastructure_desc: "The arteries of our industry are made up of rivers, roads and rails. Logically, if we are to expand our production capabilities, renewed investment in these resorts is obligatory. To support commuters, more affordable ways in and out of cities have to be realised. Derelict roads and forgotten railways will be modernised to expand the infrastructure grid even more. Lastly, the shipping industry will be funded with the creation of new docks, bridges and the connection of existing waterways via canals."

RHI_modernize_industrial_parks: "Modernize Rhenish Industry"
RHI_modernize_industrial_parks_desc: "While the Rhenish industry is fairly grand, it isn’t modern in all terms. These old machines are costing us efficiency, and more importantly, profits. Modernisation needs to come in a drive, otherwise, the Rhineland will continue to lose steam, and its industrial region will become a thing of the past."

RHI_expand_the_rheinishe_eisenbahn: "Expand the Railways"
RHI_expand_the_rheinishe_eisenbahn_desc: "The Rhenish railway network is the backbone of our infrastructure and connects our industrial centres. It is however outdated and could be expanded to serve the larger demand of our nation. Such a project of course is a great undertaking, but one that would certainly improve the situation of our state."

RHI_create_housing_intiatives: "Encourage Housing Initiatives"
RHI_create_housing_intiatives_desc: "Since the war and the rise of unemployment in the years of crisis, affordable housing has become a problem in our crowded cities. To remedy this issue we can begin the construction of new quarters with state owned houses for those who can not afford the regular housing prices. An initiative that is welcome by both, the catholics and the social democrats."

RHI_create_the_arbeitsdienst: "Set up the Arbeitsdienst"
RHI_create_the_arbeitsdienst_desc: "With many large scale projects on the horizon, we will need the workforce capable of these undertakings. We should therefore set up an Arbeitsdienst and unify the many local work programs already in place. These programs not only provide us with much needed manpower, but also help us to fight against unemployment and take away young aimless people from the fangs of radicals and give them something meaningful to do. An overall good initiative."

## army tree
RHI_rhenish_army: "Watch on the Rhine"
RHI_rhenish_army_desc: "Our state is situated along the Rhine River in the heart of Europe. We are the crossing point between the Latin and Germanic worlds. Since the bloody birth of our nation, we have had to be ever vigilant from those who wanted to march in and hang us for treason and our so-called allies who would like to further take away our rights as free men of the Rhineland. To protect ourselves, we need strong, willing, and able men who are ready to protect the people of the Rhine from all those who want to subjugate us again."

RHI_joint_exercises_with_lowlands: "Joint Exercises in the Lowlands"
RHI_joint_exercises_with_lowlands_desc: "It is important that we do not become overly reliant on the French. The lowlands and Belgium are of special strategic interest to us and friendly neighbors with similar goals. We should seek closer military cooperation and exercises with these nations. Surely our forces could benefit from each other."

RHI_contact_dissident_reichswehr_officers: "Contact Reichswehr Dissidents"
RHI_contact_dissident_reichswehr_officers_desc: "The Reichswehr has one of the best officer corps in Europe and is a battle-hardened force forged in the fires of the Great War. Our militias could learn a lot and professionalize to a significant degree if we could tap into their knowledge and expertise. Sadly, however, most of the Reichswehr has sided with Dressler. There are however those few dissidents who together with Kurt von Schleicher were forced out of power. We should seek out these men and welcome all those with open arms who are not willing to serve Valkist interests. The risks are worth it."

RHI_invite_french_military_advisors: "Work with the French"
RHI_invite_french_military_advisors_desc: "While painful to admit, we can't survive without the French. The Valkist threat is simply too great for our small force to face alone. It's time to bury the hatchet and seek mutual cooperation. While this move will understandably be unpopular with many, the openly expansionist foreign policy of the Reich has already convinced quite a few, especially those politically persecuted that we now need to form a strong alliance with the western powers if we want to survive the coming years. France as of now is the only one who can offer the needed protection. "

RHI_joint_defence_strategy: "Joint Defence Strategy"
RHI_joint_defence_strategy_desc: "While it is not preferred, we must align ourselves with the west and allow our country to act as an Entente basis of operations if we wish to be protected from Berlin should war come. We will incorporate our militia forces and our defensive positions along the Rhine into the Entente war plans. Furthermore, a joint high command should be established with our forces incorporated into the Entente defensive lines."

RHI_use_reichswehr_old_surplus: "Use Old Reichswehr Surplus"
RHI_use_reichswehr_old_surplus_desc: "The disarmament of the Imperial Army and the Reichswehr’s evacuation from the Rhineland has led to large stocks of equipment being left behind. While somewhat outdated, these arms are still quite serviceable, and could prove vital in our quest to professionalise the Rhenish militias. We will try to standardise equipment and training methods using these helpful supplies and hopefully be able to properly equip some divisions in the near future."

RHI_knife_in_dressler_reich: "Skewering Berlin"
RHI_knife_in_dressler_reich_desc: "Our strategic position is very valuable to the Western allies, we threaten one of the most resource-rich industrial heartlands of the Reich and offer a safe haven for any dissidents. Covert operations can be executed from the safety of Koblenz and the Rhine border has become one of the heaviest fortified and supervised borders in the world. The Entente knows of our strategic advantage and we can use that to our benefit."

RHI_create_rhenish_officer_corp: "Rhenish Officer Corp"
RHI_create_rhenish_officer_corp_desc: "By creating an official and organized officer corps, we can ensure our leaders on the field are competent and knowledgeable enough to properly wage war. This will go a long way to formally organize our ragtag group of militias under French support and further emancipate ourselves from the reliance on French expertise. Such an officer corps should preferably be created by those who already have knowledge on the field. We will seek out retired officers, political dissidents or local leaders."

RHI_incorporate_schutztruppe: "Incorporate the Schutztruppe"
RHI_incorporate_schutztruppe_desc: " The Schutztruppe have proudly protected our fledgling state in its times of need, but their strong political nature and violent tactics are widely despised by many of the Rheinish populace. Due to recent developments, we must create a new military and the Schutztruppe’s willingness to fight for the Rhineland make them the perfect candidates as a basis. Once we root out the unruly elements, instill some discipline and with the help of the French organised stable supply and payment, we will be able to end their worst excesses and create a usable modern army."

RHI_trad_army: "The Tried and True Way"
RHI_trad_army_desc: "The Great War has taught us many lessons and has shown us how modern warfare is conducted. By focusing on the strategies that have proven themselves already, we may ensure our future in these turbulent times. Overwhelming firepower and strong defenses coupled with a mobile doctrine will ensure that we can resist any threat to come."

RHI_mobilize_forces: "Enhance Maneuver Capabilities"
RHI_mobilize_forces_desc: "A new and modern force is needed and the Great War has shown how important mobility on the battlefield can be. We can not allow ourselves to be pinned down in trench warfare, instead we will need to invest in a small motorised force which can be quickly deployed and outmanoeuvre our likely numerically superior foes. To achieve that we will greatly invest in the expansion of infrastructure, the motorisation of our troops and flexible combat doctrines."

RHI_rhein_military_industry: "Our Own Military Industries"
RHI_rhein_military_industry_desc: "By removing any reliance on other possibly hostile nations for our military production, we can ensure that no matter who challenges us, he will face a strong Rhineland. We will expand already existing industries and greatly subsidise whatever can help to further the defence of our nation. In such times, a militarised economy is a matter of national survival."

RHI_modernize_equipment: "Modernise Our Equipment"
RHI_modernize_equipment_desc: "Our current equipment is mostly based on old Great War surplus or whatever the French army could spare us. We certainly leak modern state of the art technology. While that was fine for simple militias tasked to keep order, it is a death sentence to any fighting force. The old equipment is comparably more Napoleonic than any modern rifle, if we are to compete with our adversaries, then we must progress or die. Our emerging industry and western allies will be of great help with these efforts."

RHI_swiss_militia: "The Swiss Model"
RHI_swiss_militia_desc: "The Swiss armed forces are built around a system of militias, in contrast to a professional army. Every male citizen of military age is expected to serve. With Berlin outnumbering us significantly, we must be ready to fight a total struggle that involves the entire Rhenish people. Their national defence doctrine can be a great example to us and we should seek out military advice from this armed neutral nation. "

RHI_citizen_support_mandate: "Citizen Support Mandate"
RHI_citizen_support_mandate_desc: "Citizens will be mandated to support the national defence in any way the state deems necessary. This is an expansion of the militia system and involves passive support roles, like work in the health sector, armament industry or other supporting sectors. Every citizen therefore is also eligible to certain benefits depending on the circumstances. This outlines the legal framework for a militarised economy and a full national mobilisation in the event of a war, without endangering the personal rights of our people. Furthermore we want to prevent the rich and powerful from carrying valuable resources outside of our nation."

RHI_lower_recruit_age: "Lower Recruitment Age"
RHI_lower_recruit_age_desc: "We will have to lower the recruitment age to fill out the manpower requirements if we want to have an effective army which can defend our nation for an extended period of time until our allies arrive. Able bodied man of the age of 16 can serve in support roles and in combat roles by the age of 17. Furthermore we will also allow women to serve in support roles of the army. While this move is controversial it is necessary."

RHI_anti_tank: "Anti Tank Weaponry"
RHI_anti_tank_desc: "Since we lack the resources to develop a meaningful modern tank force, we should focus on increasing the combat capabilities of our infantry squads. By focusing on the development of anti-tank weaponry, our infantry squads can finally stand up against the metal monsters of the battlefield."

RHI_rhenish_line: "Rhenish Line"
RHI_rhenish_line_desc: "The Rhine is our most vital defensive line, since our nation has almost no strategic depth. We will need to make sure that we put all our fortification efforts into this defensive line. We will take examples from the Maginot line our allies have built. The Rhine will be our shield against Valkist expansionism. Construction of a vast network of fortifications and bunkers has already begun."

RHI_french_artillery: "Purchase French Artillery"
RHI_french_artillery_desc: "As much as we would prefer to rely on our own military production, the French have undoubtedly advanced greatly in this field and boost a way larger production capability then we do. We should purchase access to their equipment and surplus in order to provide maximum firepower and fill in any gaps in equipment we have right now. This would greatly speed up our creation of a proper artillery force. "

RHI_train_tank_force: "Train a Tank Force"
RHI_train_tank_force_desc: "With the ongoing motorization efforts, we should also invest into an armoured spearhead to lead our infantry and counter enemy tanks. This force will be a small and elite fighting corps tasked with plugging any holes in our defensive lines and be quickly deployed where our infantry might be overwhelmed. Our industry has already created several design proposals for Rhenish tanks."
RHI_tank_division_tt: "§7We will gain an §Yarmoured division§! template with the following composition:\n - 5 £GFX_unit_light_armor_icon_small battalions\n - 4 £GFX_unit_motorized_icon_small battalions\n\nSpawn §Y1§! division with newly gained template§!\n"

RHI_thunder_on_rhein: "Thunder on the Rhine"
RHI_thunder_on_rhein_desc: "The Rhine is fortified with artillery, anti-air and bunkers as far the eye can see, our tanks are ready to strike down any enemy incursion. The Shield and Sword of a free Rhineland is ready for battle."

RHI_create_landwehren: "Create the Landwehren"
RHI_create_landwehren_desc: "By organising our militias into local resistance groups, we can harass enemy troops should they break through our lines and occupy our lands until western support arrives. This will give us some defensive depth and buy time for our troops. Furthermore it adds to the organisation of our militia system."

RHI_incorporate_schutzbund: "Incorporate the Schützenbünde"
RHI_incorporate_schutzbund_desc: "The Schützenbünde are a great group of hunters, sportsmen and local groups who train with the rifle and hold local cultural festivals. These could be an important part not only of local patriotism but also in our defence against foreign invasion since those men, with their experience, would make the perfect reservists."

RHI_fund_luftschutz: "Fund the Luftschutzbund"
RHI_fund_luftschutz_desc: "By aiding the civilian Luftschutzbund in their anti-air precautions, we can more effectively defend the Rhineland from bombings and enemy air incursions. It will surely help the morale of our citizens if they know that we are prepared for the worst and that they are not just sitting ducks. Our anti-air strategy will be a broad approach centred around securing the population centred first and foremost"

RHI_crackdown_extremism: "Crackdown on Radicals"
RHI_crackdown_extremism_desc: "Radicals, socialist or conservative, are known for being a pain in the Rhenish state. Their extreme ideals have gone too far, with revolutionaries and reactionaries getting in the way, and as such, they need to be silenced by any means."

RHI_republican_coalition: "The Republican Coalition"

RHI_pursue_querfront_desc: "For a long time, the social democrats have been at the sidelines, with their popularity having historically been somewhat mediocre in the Rhineland.

RHI_political_burgfrieden_desc: "The republic is in crisis, a crisis so severe all of German democracy is at risk of being annihilated should we fail.

RHI_dorten_adenauer_federalism: "Free the States"
RHI_dorten_adenauer_federalism_desc: "For too long, the many great states of the Reich have been kept down and oppressed by the stranglehold of the Prussian menace.

If the Constitution was to be amended in ways that benefited us, we would be on the way to becoming a European power."

RHI_design_federal_republic: "Design a Federal Republic"
RHI_design_federal_republic_desc: "The old Reich was simply far too controlling of the states to prevent such a catastrophe as 1932. Had the central government allowed the states to simply deal with the problems until it became a risk to German democracy, Dressler would simply go down in history as a failed emulator of Belgrade. The era of the old Reich is finished."

RHI_form_great_coalition: "Form a Great Coalition"
RHI_form_great_coalition_desc: "Even if we all disagree on nearly all policies and issues, the parties for the old republic cannot allow themselves to bicker in German democracy’s greatest crisis yet. A coalition from the social democrats to those right of the centre is simply the first step towards a restoration of democracy across Germany."

RHI_limit_freedom_press: "Limit the Freedom of Press"
RHI_limit_freedom_press_desc: "There are far too many unsettled and confidential government affairs being released that may spark unrest and questioning of the legitimacy of our government. By limiting and monitoring the fabrication of the press,  we are limiting public criticism about the state in a non-brutal manner. "

RHI_reform_state_organs: "Reform the State Organs"
RHI_reform_state_organs_desc: "Many of the organs of state are filled with bureaucrats who are at best French collaborators and at worst outright hostile to democracy.

RHI_accept_german_refugees: "Accept German Refugees"
RHI_accept_german_refugees_desc: "Ever since the disaster of 1932, many Germans have begun to flee into freer nations that stand for democracy.

RHI_das_ganze_deutschland_soll_es_sein_desc: "Many within our ranks are at best skeptical of the notion that we are the legitimate German government.

RHI_federal_german_state: "The Federal Republic"
RHI_federal_german_state_desc: "The road ahead will not be easy, nor will it be simple either. We stand against a mightier foe, with a ravenous desire to destroy liberty and bring Germany into an unwinnable war that will see it ripped apart and humiliated a second time.

RHI_truce_communists_desc: "Even though we fundamentally disagree with the radical socialists, we will have to face the reality of the situation and should entertain the idea of a truce with the groups to face the larger issues at hand.

RHI_declare_rival_government: "The Koblenz Government"
RHI_declare_rival_government_desc: "Despite our current stance towards the illegitimate Valkist government in Berlin, we still have yet to officially declare ourselves a separate government from them.

RHI_the_german_union: "The German Union"
RHI_the_german_union_desc: "A long time ago, Germany was once a confederation of states. Each state had its leader and laws, so long as it followed the confederation’s legislature. Akin to the United States, we were able to settle our differences whenever there were problems with each other. While it ended with its dissolution, we cannot deny how it still survived for a few decades in such a chaotic era, especially after the Napoleonic wars. It’s time we bring it back and ensure that it will survive until the end of time. The German Union will be reborn!"

RHI_secure_rights_member_states: "Secure the States' Rights"
RHI_secure_rights_member_states_desc: "One of the reasons the past confederation failed is that we were unable to curb the infighting between members and their ability to compromise with each other. If we want to avoid this mistake, we must ensure that every state, no matter how big or small, has every right to defend itself in trial. The Union does not take lightly on members who wish to sway the court with bribery or force. We must be ready to stay as civil as possible in all affairs."

RHI_establish_elitoc_desc: "Whenever in times of crisis or war, the Roman Republic installed a dictator, one who would navigate through the immense crisis, if it would succeed or not. We must mirror ourselves in the past and work to the future. Whenever we are threatened, a leader shall democratically emerge to navigate through it, and it will be the people’s will for it to remain or not."

RHI_form_directory: "Form the Directory"
RHI_form_directory_desc: "Political bickering in Weimar led to failure - the lack of compromise of parties and leaders created the opportunity for Dressler and his lackeys to strike. The heart of the problem is evident: division between the states. The problem goes further though, as electing one leader enshrines their movement. A directory would be better, as we would be representing all of the interests without an enshrined movement."

RHI_west_german_republic_back: "Cement the Western Republic"
RHI_west_german_republic_back_desc: "To contest the odds is to be brave - The West German Republic will be a light for those in need, for those fleeing from the anarchistic states to the west from the east. With Germany beaten and Prussia laid low, let us light the torch so we can watch the hydra burn."

RHI_maintain_rhenish_supremacy: "Uphold Rhenish Supremacy"
RHI_maintain_rhenish_supremacy_desc: "The backbone of our republic is the Rhineland, and as such should be treated with the dignity and respect it failed to receive in the past. Their problems are our problems and we must help in whatever we can. While we could profit from other states' support, we first need to maintain ourselves."

RHI_reach_out_to_hessians: "Settle with the Hessians"
RHI_reach_out_to_hessians_desc: "While we cannot forget the Rhineland and its importance, the Hessians also demand part of our work. Reaching out to them may prove beneficial as another pillar to support our popularity and republic. Besides that, the Hessians are proving themselves to be a powerful ally each day that passes."

RHI_reconcile_republicans: "Reintegrate the Republicans"
RHI_reconcile_republicans_desc: "The Republicans of Weimar had a dream that couldn’t be achieved in turbulent times, but now that the republic was restored, the dream of Weimar just reemerged, with double the strength.The republicans that once lost the dream are now in range for reintegration, and finally, the death of our Old Republic shall truly be avenged."

RHI_destroy_all_prussianism: "Enshrine the States' Freedoms"
RHI_destroy_all_prussianism_desc: "Whenever the freedom of the states was threatened, no one answered. The Prussians abused their authority to enshrine Prussia at the top of the hierarchy of states - But Prussia is dead. Prussianism and its evils are a forgotten past, but some still believe in them. For the safety of the republic and Germany, we must clean them out."

RHI_devolve_further_autonomy: "Devolve State Responsibilities"
RHI_devolve_further_autonomy_desc: "We have seen the risks that a centralised German state poses to the liberty of the German people - especially states as oppressive as Prussia. We must ensure that the individual states are not merely able to breathe, but to prosper!"

RHI_ally_regionalist_parties: "Collaborate with Regionalists"
RHI_ally_regionalist_parties_desc: "There exist many regional parties such as the German-Hanoverian Party and the Bavarian People's Party. Cooperation with them will enable us to further federalise Germany."

RHI_first_among_dem_states: "The First Free State"
RHI_first_among_dem_states_desc: "Where did liberty in the now-free Germany originate from? Sure, the Prussian Weimar state may have been democratic, but where did true freedom come from? The Rhineland was where we came from and must be duly granted recognition and privileges as the first state of the Union."

RHI_promise_bavaria_more_autonomy: "Work with the Bavarians"
RHI_promise_bavaria_more_autonomy_desc: "Bavaria was the largest state in the German Empire after Prussia, and has a strong regional identity. We therefore should work with them to ensure that the Union’s integrity can be maintained away from the centralizing forces of the North."

RHI_leverage_northern_resentment: "Leverage Northern Resentment"
RHI_leverage_northern_resentment_desc: "The intransigence of the south cannot be denied in many cases, especially if one remembers 1923 and 1932. The north German states have much to be upset about, which will help us in ensuring the cooperation of all states in the new Union."

RHI_ehre_freiheit_vaterland: "Ehre Freiheit Vaterland"
RHI_ehre_freiheit_vaterland_desc: "Germany and her people are free. Instead of a dictatorship from any one big city or state, every German is free to fight their battles and live their lives without fearing centralist control. Even if we may disagree at times, Germany shall ascend in liberty and grace!"

RHI_in_service_of_germany: "Serving the Homeland"
RHI_in_service_of_germany_desc: "Even if we do not share the same power-hungry desires of the Prussian kings, Germany’s interests must still be upheld. Humiliation at the whims of autocratic Slavs and a prospective subjugation to the Western powers must be averted - lest Germany finds herself a slave of the world."

RHI_implement_national_armies: "Implement National Armies"
RHI_implement_national_armies_desc: "Is it not a free state’s right to defend themselves? Although the prospect of federalizing the national armies may churn the stomach for some crypto-Prussians, the reality is that a free Germany must allow her states to decide the best way to defend themselves."

RHI_allow_former_reichswehr: "Reallow Former Reichswehr Officers"
RHI_allow_former_reichswehr_desc: "While somewhat distasteful, it is clear the best way to rebuild the army is to employ ex-Reichswehr members.They have talent and experience the new army cannot afford to ignore. "

RHI_expel_reactionary_officers: "Sweep Out Prussian Rot"
RHI_expel_reactionary_officers_desc: "The former Reichswehr personnel cannot be trusted. The army of Weimar never had the Republic's best interests at heart, undermining democracy at every opportunity. It would be foolish to employ them."

RHI_formulate_defensive_strategy: "Outline Defence Plans"
RHI_formulate_defensive_strategy_desc: "While we do not expect war to break out, there are still potential enemies on the world stage. It would not hurt to create new defensive plans in case of attack."

RHI_establish_zentralbehorde: "Establish the Zentralbehörde"
RHI_establish_zentralbehorde_desc: "Even in the new Germany we are creating, there are still many pitiful radicals who would like to see themselves as the new dictator of Germany. We must crush them lest they fool the people with false promises - which shall be done under the Zentralbehörde!"

RHI_crush_valkism_communism: "Crush the Extremists"
RHI_crush_valkism_communism_desc: "Whether they be Valkist remnants or upstart reds, extremism still festers in the Union. We shall take the next step to ensure that this infestation of radicals will once and for all be extinguished!"

RHI_legacy_of_48_desc: "We remember the legacy of our ancestors. Their desire for a free and liberal Germany in a free and liberal Europe cannot be simply forgotten. Even if we are unable to carry this task to the rest of Europe, we shall not let them down - for Germany shall become a beacon of liberty and life in Europe!"

RHI_reaffirm_peace_commitment: "Reaffirm Peace Commitments"
RHI_reaffirm_peace_commitment_desc: "When peace was tarnished by warmongers, Germany found herself on the losing end of two world wars. In doing so, how many countless innocents have lost their lives? How many more mothers must lose their sons? How many more children find themselves orphans? We must commit to peace to ensure that Germany never forgets."

RHI_towards_a_united_europe: "Towards a United Europe"
RHI_towards_a_united_europe_desc: "The only way to find peace in the European continent is by creating a united Europe and bringing all the European peoples under one flag, and one country. Even if this seems impossible for us today, it cannot be deemed too hard to not try. We must hence set the groundwork and work towards a free and prosperous Europe!"

RHI_a_policy_of_neutrality: "Declare Our Neutrality"
RHI_a_policy_of_neutrality_desc: "The German nation was bled dry by the first Great War. Fathers and sons were sent to die in the trenches. The second one saw Germany become a battleground, bringing devastation not seen since Napoleon and The Thirty Years War. No more shall we march towards wars of conquest, or be a chessboard for great powers!"

RHI_create_reconstructionfonds: "Create Reconstructionfonds"
RHI_create_reconstructionfonds_desc: "Private capital is not enough to see that Germany is rebuilt - the states too cannot hoard all of their riches for just themselves. Germany can only recover from the horrors of war together - making the creation of a shared fund for reconstruction an absolute priority."

RHI_create_union_broadcasting_company: "Bundes-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft"
RHI_create_union_broadcasting_company_desc: "Inspired by the BBC, creating a state run broadcasting service would provide a bulwark against private media outlets and enable us to create a standardised network of radio stations across Germany that will counter the flood of falsities spread by radicals."

RHI_establish_landergewerkschaften: "Establish Landergewerkschaften"
RHI_establish_landergewerkschaften_desc: "We must ensure that no worker in Germany feels too exploited by capital, lest they turn towards Marxism. To this end, we must ensure that trade unions, which have always been constructive, are established in all states to the benefit of the workers."

RHI_decentralised_banking_system: "Decentralize the Banks"
RHI_decentralised_banking_system_desc: "The Reichsbank played a key role in financing the Imperial and Valkist War machines. It is clear the idea of a central bank, while useful, is too dangerous as it is employed and must be avoided. "

RHI_work_with_the_industrialists: "Work with the Industrialists"
RHI_work_with_the_industrialists_desc: "It is clear the fastest way towards reconstruction is by cooperating with the various industrialists. Their almost unlimited resources would be a great boon for the reconstruction process."

RHI_destroy_prussian_arsenals: "Destroy the Prussian War Machine"
RHI_destroy_prussian_arsenals_desc: "It is clear the best way to neuter the Prussian eagle is to destroy the great arsenals. Corporations such as Krupp and Mauser will therefore be dissolved, and their factories repurposed, not for the interests of corrupt oligarchs but for the people's welfare."

RHI_keep_military_preparations: "Maintain Military Production"
RHI_keep_military_preparations_desc: "While many in the government wish for demilitarisation, it is clear that there are still threats to Germany on the horizon. Therefore we must ensure that we are ready and prepared to protect Germany and her independence."

RHI_union_worker_laws: "Enact Worker Protections"
RHI_union_worker_laws_desc: "The working class must not be exploited by predatory capitalists and greedy politicians. Protections for the workers ought to be covered as basic civil rights, one guaranteed and enforced by law."

RHI_the_heart_of_europe: "The Industrial Heart of Europe"
RHI_the_heart_of_europe_desc: "The Rhineland is not only geographically the center of Europe, it has been a trading center since the Middle Ages. The Rhine River is a major artery of economic life flowing through the continent. Through continuous investments, industrial expansion, and hard labor we have created an economic powerhouse that is among the top of the world. Machines are running, chimneys dotting the horizon are blowing thick smoke into the sky, and railway lines cut through the rolling hills and fields of this growing marvel of mankind. A beating heart of machines and steel."


## the final republican tree
RHI_phoenix_of_republic: "The Republic Reborn"
RHI_phoenix_of_republic_desc: "In its greatest trial yet, German democracy has won. The Valkist beast and all of its derivatives have been smashed and the power of the tyranny in Germany has been dealt an irrevocable blow. Let us celebrate this day; the day where the phoenix of the republic rises once again!"

RHI_rebuilding_the_republic: "Rebuilding the Republic"
RHI_rebuilding_the_republic_desc: "The old Republic may have died but its stalwart defenders have continued tirelessly to fight against tyranny and bring back the spirit of freedom to the German lands. We now have the opportunity to build something new, something great that will last for centuries to come. Long live Germany, long live the Republic!"

RHI_reform_banking_sector: "Reform the Banks"
RHI_reform_banking_sector_desc: "The banking system dates back to the corrupt, fragile era of the Weimar where inflation soared and the entire economy was on the utter brink of total collapse. We must ensure that we are keeping ourselves safe from any damage to the economy if a crisis were to occur and if we reform it in aspects that must be worked on we perhaps could even benefit us."

RHI_dealing_with_the_railways: "Dealing with the Railways"
RHI_dealing_with_the_railways_desc: "Our railway system is far too disorganized and of a bygone age. We must show to our enemies that we are stronger than them and can easily be capable of transporting large amounts of items in just a couple of days. This will massively benefit us in trade and supply as we will be able to transfer items across fronts in no time!"

RHI_compromise_remaining_industrialists: "Elicit Industrial Support"
RHI_compromise_remaining_industrialists_desc: "The remaining industrialists, mostly smaller fish than the powerful barons of industry of the old Republic, should be on board with our new Republican project if we give them some concessions. Since we aim for a free market economy opposed to the Valkists or socialists, we can surely find a middle ground. The support of industry will most certainly make rebuilding and new projects much easier."

RHI_decide_grain_issue: "The Grain Issue"
RHI_decide_grain_issue_desc: "The grain prices have been a point of contention since the old republic, due to trade, many farmers were to able to compete with imports and thus went into financial hardship. A large reason for the agrarian interest parties and radicalisation of the rural population was the focus on urban development over rural issues. We will uphold the grain subsidies but focus to reform our agriculture through investments into more economically sustainable models. Now that the Junkers are gone, a compromise should be hard but possible. Meanwhile the food security will allow for a midterm solution with the state buying surplus products."

RHI_learn_mistakes_weimar: "Address Structural Problems"
RHI_learn_mistakes_weimar_desc: "There have been many problems which plagued the old Republic and continued to be present in the Rhineland. Additionally, with the nature of how our state was created, we introduced a lot of new issues into the political scene. To modernise our state and prevent the festering of these issues, we will need to investigate and reform our administration and invest our full efforts into solving these structural issues. Be it corruption, inefficient bureaucracy or underdeveloped infrastructure, we will be determined to build the foundation for a strong Germany."

RHI_spectre_prussia: "The Prussian Ghost"
RHI_spectre_prussia_desc: "The Prussian ghost, it haunts Germany to this day. Ever since the creation of Germany, Prussia has been the most conservative, bureaucracy-bloated, and aristocratic-based state in all of Germany. The Junkers, the Kaiser and the Military made up the majority of the politics - this legacy haunts us, and it is time to exorcise the Prussian demon."

RHI_break_regionalist_sentiments: "Break Regionalist Sentiments"
RHI_break_regionalist_sentiments_desc: "The ongoing struggles between the Länder and Berlin has allowed the reactionaries and later Valkists to come to power in Bavaria and then the nation. The left similarly tried to capture the workers of Saxony and Thuringia. This can not happen again and we should not allow localism and regionalism to be a threat to the Republic and democracy again."

RHI_red_prussia: "The Republican Stronghold"
RHI_red_prussia_desc: "Under Otto Braun, Prussia was expanded to be a stronghold of republican and reformist ideas like no other state in Germany. It had a stable and modern government for years, despite the socialist undertones such a SPD led government may bring, it serves as a great reminder what a competent administration is able to do even under the circumstances it faced back then. We should bring back the spirit of this Prussia and wipe the reactionary Prussia clean from Germany’s slate."

RHI_downsize_the_giant: "Downsize the Giant"
RHI_downsize_the_giant_desc: "The Prussian state has dominated politics of Germany in a way that is not befitting our democratic and liberal ideas anymore. It might have been understandable during the times of imperial Germany, when the German state was really just a Prussian Empire, but today there is no reason for this anymore. As seen in how Schleicher toppled its government with his military goons and used Prussia to effectively rule over all of Germany that remained, Prussia’s size makes it an unwieldy state. At this critical point, Reichsreform is of the utmost importance and we ought to establish a proper federal Germany."

RHI_emancipate_reichsrat: "Compromise with the States"
RHI_emancipate_reichsrat_desc: "Since the days of the Empire, localism and particularist interests have plagued politics.We do of course realise the federalist history of Germany and the benefits it has brought to us but we need to ensure that the rights of the federal government are realised and recognized to ensure smooth and effective governance. After all, we all saw the pitfall of the old Republic. Therefore we will enshrine the Länderkompetenzen and a 5% clause for party representation in our constitution while recognizing the rights of the states in other areas like education and policing duties."

RHI_reverse_berlin_centralization: "Reverse Berlin's Centralization"
RHI_reverse_berlin_centralization_desc: "The Valkists redrew the borders of the German States, ignoring traditional boundaries and regional identities. Germany is not a nation of one race but a collection of multiple identities with different cultures. This meddling from Berlin shall end."

RHI_remove_prussia: "Finish Off Prussia"
RHI_remove_prussia_desc: " Prussia, not only as a political entity but as an idea, is the source of Germany’s woes. They sent millions to die in the trenches, while Prussian militarism unleashed untold misery upon Europe for generations. Prussia must die so  Germany can live."

RHI_replace_reichsrat: "Inaugurate the Federal Republic"
RHI_replace_reichsrat_desc: "The historic moment has arrived for Germany to embark on a transformative journey. By inaugurating the new republic, we lay the foundation for a unified, progressive nation committed to the ideals of equality, justice, and collective prosperity. From now on, Prussia cannot threaten German democracy."

RHI_redraw_state_boundaries: "Balance State Size"
RHI_redraw_state_boundaries_desc: "The main reason the Prussians dominated Germany in the first place was their sheer size. We cannot let this happen in our new republic, where many states may naturally organize or remain too small or large. We shall rectify this at once to maintain an equilibrium within the nation."

RHI_leave_the_states_be: "Leave the States Be"
RHI_leave_the_states_be_desc: "We should not aggressively assert our dominance over the politics of our member states, after all, the various German regions all have their local identities to protect and live by, just like the Rhineland has. We should aim to work with the states as partners in a federal order instead. As a true union of the German people we will become more than the sum of our parts and protect local identities and customs. The German state will finally truly be German instead of only Prussian, only Austrian or only Rhenish. "

RHI_seize_junker_estates: "Seize Junker Estates"
RHI_seize_junker_estates_desc: "The Junkers are greedy fools who love nothing more than to fill their own pockets. The Germans have had enough! It is time to declare that all Junkers must surrender their estates to the government; lest they want them taken by force!"

RHI_eliminate_reactionary_groups: "Clean Out Reactionaries"
RHI_eliminate_reactionary_groups_desc: "Now that we have secured our nation, we need to get rid of the remaining reactionary hardlines to open the path towards a new and better future for Germany. To not redo the mistakes of the past we will focus on destroying whatever radical nationalistic group that may arise again. It makes no difference if they fight against the reds as the old Republic has shown us. At the end of the day they would always move against us if they have the chance, therefore there can be and never will be any cooperation with these reactionary nationalists."

RHI_the_new_threat: "Focus on the New Threat"
RHI_the_new_threat_desc: "We have fought against the nationalists, we defeated the Valkists, it is time that we stop closing our eyes to the remaining threat to our freedom. We can not let ourselves be guilt tripped into abandoning our national pride and trust in freedom just because Valkists and other radicals abused the values of honour and patriotism. It was them, the KPD, their Red militias and renegade trade unionists, who in times of need decided to fight against our state and democracy. We need to finally exorcise this demon."

RHI_cultural_offensive_valkism: "Villainize Valkist Culture"
RHI_cultural_offensive_valkism_desc: "Valkism has ingrained itself into our society. They defy the long traditions and morals of German culture. These men have no sense of morality, no god, and no true vision for a German state besides their fetish for war and misery.  It is time we show our people that they are bastards who attempt to poison their minds with false promises and vicious lies."

RHI_break_valkist_strangelhold_bavaria: "Operation Kopfsprung"
RHI_break_valkist_strangelhold_bavaria_desc: "The Valkists have retreated to their last strongholds in Bavaria and are attempting to turn it into an independent state. The police and the military are ready to launch the raid to prevent this last insurrection and finish off the Valkists once and for all."

RHI_end_prussian_militarism: "Overcome Prussian Militarism"
RHI_end_prussian_militarism_desc: "Our days of militarism and Prussian autocracy are gone, there is no place for the Junkers or OHL - we, the heirs of the republican mantle, must have democracy and freedom in mind, be it in the military or in political system. The old men can cope, but with a new era, there are new ideas that deserve the spotlight."

RHI_the_question_of_former_valkists: "Deal with the Remaining Valkists"
RHI_the_question_of_former_valkists_desc: "Valkism is a sickness, if it is not eliminated in time, it will spread like one. To prevent another war, and revanchism from coming back, we must eliminate the remaining pockets of resistance, there is no negotiations with rebels."

RHI_einigkeit_und_recht_und_freiheit: "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit"
RHI_einigkeit_und_recht_und_freiheit_desc: "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit, unity of the German people, justice for all and freedom to all. The unofficial motto of the republic is a good way of describing our goals, to serve the population is to have honour. We crossed a rough path to be where we are now - from a simple base in the Rhineland, to the bright German Republic, the path of democracy... The path ahead seems bright for us, let all know that the republican dream has come true."

RHI_defending_the_republic: "Defending the Republic"
RHI_defending_the_republic_desc: "It is not enough that we are free from the yokes of foreign oppression and homegrown tyranny, we will need to ensure that it stays this way. Therefore it will be necessary to build a strong state both at the field of battle and in the hearts of its people to resist all tyrants which aim to threaten our way of life."

RHI_purge_reichswehr: "Purge Anti-Republican Officers"
RHI_purge_reichswehr_desc: "We have learned that revolutions are only successful if a large part of the military command supports traitorous elements. Not only that, but we have also learned that a large proportion of our officers are filled to the brim with reactionary fossils. We must act if we are to purify our military with republican-minded officers and ensure the survival of democracy."

RHI_forgive_the_opportunists: "Forgive the Opportunists"
RHI_forgive_the_opportunists_desc: "Many might have joined the Valkists out of pressure and to simply save themselves from the excessive repression. We need to open avenues for those people to return to the fold of the democratic state that was taken from them. When it comes to the armed forces, this fact might be especially evident, after all, since Schleicher's reign, many officers and old nobles were viewed with extreme distrust. Our army would certainly benefit if we hand an olive branch to them."

RHI_build_democratic_army: "Rebuild the Army"
RHI_build_democratic_army_desc: "The army is made out of reactionary officers, who desire to subvert democracy in our country. If we wish to secure democracy, we need to create a democratic army. One where a soldier knows he fights for his voice, for the right to vote, for the right of justice and unity. One heer, united, above reactionary politics."

RHI_business_oriented_foreign_policy: "Into the World"
RHI_business_oriented_foreign_policy_desc: "With Germany's industrial heartland under our rule and an influx of foreign companies setting up shop, we must ensure Germany not only becomes the arsenal of European Democracy, but also its workshop! "

RHI_oppose_tyrannical_socialism: "Oppose Communist Expansionism"
RHI_oppose_tyrannical_socialism_desc: "Radical socialists and communists would seek to weaponize the people against the unity of our nation to tear down all that we have sacrificed to build. Their influences grow with every expansion, with every nation that falls under their manipulation, and to that, we say \"No more!\""

RHI_support_reichsbanner: "Reform the Reichsbanner"
RHI_support_reichsbanner_desc: "An organisation that fights for democracy, an organisation that fights Valkism - the Reichsbanner was born for the defence of the constitution, their efforts to defend the German people deserve merit. While it is good to have people like them, it won’t change much if their tactics, and command are outdated, perhaps a secret government attache will help them reform..."

RHI_economic_cooperation: "European Economic Cooperation"
RHI_economic_cooperation_desc: "With the victory of democracy, we recognize that the path to prosperity and stability lies in unity with our European neighbours. By advocating for further European economic cooperation, we will integrate our economy with fellow European nations, fostering a climate of mutual growth and solidarity. The EEC will focus on establishing common markets, aligning socialist economic policies, and investing in cross-border infrastructure. Through these efforts, we aim to reduce trade barriers, enhance resource sharing, and promote collective prosperity. Strengthening these economic ties will not only support our socialist goals but also ensure lasting peace and cooperation on the continent."

RHI_final_treaty_western_powers: "Never Another Weltkrieg"
RHI_final_treaty_western_powers_desc: "The once prosperous Reich on the road to becoming the master of Europe was taken by surprise by the plague of the Weltkrieg and what was the thriving streets of Berlin turned into poor slums with constant civil unrest and clashes. We must never ever try to get involved in any Weltkrieg otherwise the suffering for our and the German people will cost more than we can ever imagine... "

RHI_spd: "The Return of Social Democracy"
RHI_spd_desc: "The SPD has been the main pro-Democracy party, but ever since the Great War, Germany radicalism turned to the reactionaries, and the SPD was unable to avert Dressler’s rise to power. However, that was not the end of it, the SPD never faded away, ex-members remember its legacy that will now continue in a free Germany!"

RHI_democratize_bureaucracy: "Democratize the Bureaucracy"
RHI_democratize_bureaucracy_desc: "The bureaucratic class has often been filled with reactionaries and other anti-democratic elements. The Weimar government attempted to democratise, and modernise the bureaucracy, but in the end, only corruption emerged from it. We need to rebuild it and turn it into a bureaucracy that will uphold the republic."

RHI_expand_reichsbanner: "Expand the Reichsbanner"
RHI_expand_reichsbanner_desc: "Even though the Reichsbanner’s efforts are honourable, they are still a small organisation compared to the other paramilitaries. It is in theirs, and our best interest to protect Germany, and as such, we will help them expand their organisation."

RHI_united_front_policies: "Support Anti-Valkist Fronts"
RHI_united_front_policies_desc: "The rising tide of Valkism threatens to destabilise regions of strategic importance. To counteract this growing menace, we must extend our support to anti-Valkist movements across the globe. By providing military aid, financial resources, and intelligence support, we can strengthen these factions, destabilise Valkist regimes, and promote our influence. Coordinated efforts will include supplying arms, training resistance fighters, and conducting covert operations to undermine Valkist authority. This strategy not only hampers the spread of Valkism but also aligns various factions with our long-term geopolitical goals, ensuring a global balance of power favourable to our interests."

RHI_rally_the_workers: "Rally the Workers"
RHI_rally_the_workers_desc: "The takeover of the Weimar government by reactionaries and  valkists have demonstrated that only the workers will protect German liberty and democracy from the dictatorship of the few."

RHI_remove_false_socialists: "Excise False Socialists"
RHI_remove_false_socialists_desc: "Socialism as a word has seemingly an utterly magical effect on the German people, who flock to whoever promises socialism in the most bold way. The Valkists knew this and capitalized on people’s grievances with reality to sell them lies that really only resulted in the worker’s enslavement. Many supposed social democrats joined them in this venture, and it is this group that we must expel."

RHI_eschew_reformist_principles: "Eschew Reformist Principles"
RHI_eschew_reformist_principles_desc: "The time for half-measures and compromises has passed. Reformist principles dilute our revolutionary zeal and hinder our path to true ideological purity. We must eschew these moderating influences and fully embrace radical transformation. By rejecting reformism, we can eliminate counterproductive elements within our ranks, focus on our uncompromising goals, and inspire a wave of fervent dedication among our followers. This decisive move will not only solidify our ideological stance but also inspire our supporters, ensuring that our revolution remains untainted by moderation and wholly committed to our ultimate vision of a transformed society."

RHI_the_democratic_shield: "The Democratic Shield"
RHI_the_democratic_shield_desc: "In these turbulent times, safeguarding our democracy against external and internal threats is paramount.

RHI_expel_soviet_agents_desc: "The integrity of our state is threatened by extremists who seek to undermine the principles of our revolution through violence and chaos. To safeguard our nation and uphold democracy, we must take decisive action to expel these violent revolutionaries from our ranks. We must preserve the stability and legitimacy of our socialist government."

RHI_reform_social_democracy: "German Social Democracy"
RHI_reform_social_democracy_desc: "As a new age dawns on Germany, we have successfully created a government for and by the German people. Whilst socialist values are still nonetheless important, our impotence before the Valkist takeover has determined for us a new direction. We will never again let petty infighting and concessions to radicals destroy our democracy!"

RHI_spd_coalitions: "Working with the Social Democrats"
RHI_spd_coalitions_desc: "Despite ideological differences, collaboration with the Social Democrats presents an opportunity to strengthen our socialist government and advance the interests of the working class. By forging a democratic alliance, we can leverage the expertise and resources of the Social Democrats to implement key policies and initiatives.”

RHI_begin_social_programs: "Begin Social Programs"
RHI_begin_social_programs_desc: "By creating new social programs such as welfare and an economic safety net, we can protect our citizens from the fluctuations of the unstable capitalist markets.""

RHI_ddp: "The Liberal Revival"
RHI_ddp_desc: "After the Weimar Republic fell, the Democrats alongside other parties went into exile on the Rhine. Through great struggle, the liberals of the Weimar era survived, reforming themselves into a new party. With our victory over Valkism, liberalism has been truly revived in Germany."

RHI_naumanns_legacy: "Naumann's Legacy"
RHI_naumanns_legacy_desc: "Friederich Naumann, the creator and founder of the DDP, most importantly, a German with dreams of liberty. Liberalism and freedom, as the DDP was created to serve those principles. Even after his death, the legacy of his name will live on in the German nation and in our principles."

RHI_democratic_coalition: "Rally Republican Backers"
RHI_democratic_coalition_desc: "Now that we have secured our state and finally achieved our self determination, we need to rally in a great coalition against radicals on both sides of the political spectrum to provide a stable and sensible approach to politics. Such a great coalition will be a good bit of work to achieve but it will help us in these years of crisis."

RHI_expand_civil_protections: "Expand Civil Protections"
RHI_expand_civil_protections_desc: "Our people should be as secure as our state is, as such we must enact procedures to expand our defences of the liberty and independence of our people. We need to ensure that the rights and freedoms of our citizens are properly valued and enforced against radical people. We can not go back to the times of the old Republic, where radicals went to the streets to intimidate democratic voters or beat down workers using their right to protest."

RHI_party_of_middle: "The Middle-Class United"
RHI_party_of_middle_desc: "Who will defend the republic and the nation? The working class are drawn towards the many promises of social democracy, while the reactionary elite spend their time dreaming of returning to the Kaiserreich. Only the bourgeois can bridge the gaps in society and bring about a free and democratic Germany!"

RHI_corporate_kickbacks: "Exploit Business Ties"
RHI_corporate_kickbacks_desc: "Getting to know people inside businesses can often be lucrative, especially if the state knows them too. We will aim to hand out lucrative contracts to well trusted businessmen to increase the economic development of our nation. After all, we aim to strengthen our nation and there is nothing better to do that than to forge a strong interdependent network of corporations, business interests and money institutions. Loans from our banks funding business in our state to pay for projects which further our infrastructure and so on... Everything should run like a well oiled machine."

RHI_assert_germanies_independence: "Encourage Nationalist Views"
RHI_assert_germanies_independence_desc: "Germany is free, after years of struggle, years of the Junkers and dictators abusing us, Germany is truly free. We cannot let all of this progress go down the drain, be it because of agitators or foreign powers. We will stand for a state that protects personal freedom, the independence of our nation from all foreign powers and the freedom of the markets, the press and our economy. For a truly democratic Germany."

RHI_bolster_white_collar_unions: "Bolster White Collar Unions"
RHI_bolster_white_collar_unions_desc: "The old liberal parties and especially the DVP were always too reliant on big business and heavy industry for backing. How can liberal participation in society be made if the only liberals known to the youth are old and often elitist men? We must back the white-collar unions in a bid for bourgeois dominance to ensure that the republic can hold not just from the top, but also the middle."

RHI_free_fair_market: "The Free and Fair Market"
RHI_free_fair_market_desc: "We have come far from the times of the quasi feudal Junker led economy and the socialist tyranny. Today we have firm laws and rights in place that allow each man in our state to pursue his own interests and benefit with ingenuity and work towards the greater good of society. The economic product from this environment is thus used to ensure the continued stability of the market, prevent the rise of unfair business practices and invest into the welfare of the population. A process we call Soziale Marktwirtschaft."

RHI_german_industry_reigns: "The Eagle Ascendant"
RHI_german_industry_reigns_desc: "Germany is rising from the ashes of war and destruction again. Our industrial output is considerable and we have become a valuable partner throughout the world. Making politics in Europe without considering us has become impossible. Through good connections and cooperation with our neighbours we have deeply ingrained ourselves into the European community and finally overcame the political isolation since the war."

RHI_ddp_coalitions: "Cooperation with the Liberals"
RHI_ddp_coalitions_desc: "To build a broad coalition of the centre, we should work with the many small liberal movements that have emerged since the end of the old Republic. These parties have proven flexible and ready to join a democratic government. While there certainly are differences, especially towards the ideas of the SPD’s reformist socialist path and the Christian conservatism, they have already expressed their willingness to work out a compromise as long as we accept a minimum consensus. A good partner for our government."

RHI_encourage_neoliberalism: "Support Neoliberalism"
RHI_encourage_neoliberalism_desc: "We have seen the effects of selfish and unregulated capitalism in the past. If Germany is to prosper and her people succeed, we must encourage businesses to not simply combat, but rather make common cause with the workers in a joint effort to gain prosperity for all of Germany."

RHI_enforce_minority_protections: "Enforce Minority Protections"
RHI_enforce_minority_protections_desc: "Even the smallest of minorities can quickly turn into a radicalized group of tens of thousands overnight should we continue to allow ethnic tension to continue. We must dedicate to protecting these minorities from those that would do those harm, and especially those that seek to weaponize them. After all, all subjects of a democratic state fall under its jurisdiction and therefore also share the same rights and protection as their fellow Germans."

RHI_zentrum: "The Centre Holds"
RHI_zentrum_desc: "The Center has always been the movement of plain and simple boring sensible politics far removed from the populist screaming of the radical left and the radical right. Even in the times of the Weimar Republic, the Center was ready to be part of large coalitions of all those democrats who are willing to do what is best for the people, not what they think is best for their ideology or profit. The Center since then has faced countless attacks from all directions but yet here we are, proving that simple sensible politics always wins over dumb and sensationalist populism."

RHI_fortify_democratic_principles: "Fortify Democratic Principles"
RHI_fortify_democratic_principles_desc: "The fall of the Republic has shown us what happens when true democrats become a minority in a Republic. Instead of bickering against each other, all true leaders, all parties and all men have to be united in one noble course, the defence of our freedom and the defence of our democratic ideals. We can tolerate no movement or institution which is openly opposed to democracy and we will do our best to exorcise these demons in our new state. The people have to rule and no one but the people."

RHI_defend_christian_values: "Defend Christian Values"
RHI_defend_christian_values_desc: "Our Christian values are under attack from radicals, godless communists, and most of all, the Valkist movement. As the defenders of that which is right in Germany, we must resist any suppression of our faith and firmly fight back against any attacks against the Church and its institutions. Only our conservative christian morals and values defend us from the barbarism that has gripped the modern world."

RHI_incorporate_protestant_christians: "Leave the Tower"
RHI_incorporate_protestant_christians_desc: "The Zentrum party is proud of their Catholic support base, and its Catholic policies. However, if we ever wish to see Germany united, we will need to abandon this division. Protestants are loved under Christ just as Catholics are. There is no need to divide them in our party, even though they worship him differently."

RHI_aid_the_farmers: "Aid the Farmers"
RHI_aid_the_farmers_desc: "In our industrialized nation we have regrettably neglected the well-being of the farmers whose hands feed all from the poor to the rich. They deserve more from our nation, as such we should provide economic and equipment aid to repay our debts and promote economic growth from this neglected sector."

RHI_maintain_z_integrity: "Maintain our Integrity"
RHI_maintain_z_integrity_desc: "The Zentrum integrity will never fail, our voters picked us for what we promised and we should deliver, otherwise, we have failed as a party and as leaders. As the defenders of Catholicism in Germany we shall stay, for have we not proven ourselves in the greatest trial of German democracy yet?"

RHI_defend_the_states: "Defend the States"
RHI_defend_the_states_desc: "The states of the old Republic barely were dominated by the power of Prussia and the supremacy of Berlin, now that we are finally in power, we shall bring the long awaited Reichsreform which was already dreamed up in the 1920s and defend it noble goals. No one, man or government can violate the sacred rights of the states. We will prevent the establishment of another unitary paternalistic government and instead trust in German federalism."

RHI_combat_spd: "Combat the SPD"
RHI_combat_spd_desc: "The socialist threat posed by the SPD whilst tame is still something that must be resisted. Not only do they seek to lure away Catholics from their true defenders with their false promises, but their socialist nature enables them to make common cause with anti-republican forces in the destruction of Germany. We must take measures to combat them, both in the government and the public.”

RHI_party_of_the_right: "Party of the Right"
RHI_party_of_the_right_desc: "We are the stalwart defenders of conservatism, christian values and the traditional way of life. Neither Valkism barbarians nor socialist bandits shall ever threaten our way of life, our families, our children and the future of our nation. We will ensure the security and prosperity of all those that live under our government and stand for peace and cooperation throughout Europe."

RHI_zentrum_coalitions: "Compromising with the Centre"
RHI_zentrum_coalitions_desc: "The Centre is ever-changing and prone to conversation, and we need allies for our government's survival and comfort. Perhaps offering an olive branch to them may help mend the rift between our parties."

RHI_beat_revolutionary_tendencies: "Censor Revolutionary Tendencies"
RHI_beat_revolutionary_tendencies_desc: "Revolutionaries on both sides of the aisle promote ideas that would endanger our position on the global stage both diplomatically and militarily. There’s also talk from our sources that revolutions are being prepared from unseeing eyes. We need to act quickly to prevent further support from going into these radical organizations and back into normality."

RHI_lighten_federal_restrictions: "Lighten Federal Involvement"
RHI_lighten_federal_restrictions_desc: "One of the problems facing our people today is the overbearing government that slows everything down with regulations. We should allow the people and businesses ample space to operate freely without the unblinking eye of the government hanging overhead."

RHI_empower_unions: "Empower Friendly Unions"
RHI_empower_unions_desc: "While trade unions are always a fickle topic, we should aim to work together with those that subscribe to our state's democratic vision and gain the support of the working class that way. The goal of a social market economy that benefits everyone will be ever closer. We only need to prevent another radicalisation of these unions be it Valkist or Socialist. "

RHI_ally_local_parties: "Ally Local Parties"
RHI_ally_local_parties_desc: "Many local parties share interests with the Zentrum, many share interests in federalisation, others in Christian education, but at the end of the day, they support parts of our agenda. Meetings with the leaders of these parties are to be arranged, in the hopes of achieving common goals."


### "I love the republic" tree
RHI_national_opposition: "The National Movement"
RHI_national_opposition_desc: "Germany and the idea of the Reich are not yet dead, as we are its torch-bearers. The national republicans have proven their worth with the reconstruction of the Rhineland as the first province of a restored Reich. Schleicher’s ideas of a new corporate state will guide us forward against Valkist barbarism and the weakness of the first Republic. No more French, no more separatists, only strength and unity for the Fatherland."

RHI_german_fatherland_front: "Entrench the Front"
RHI_german_fatherland_front_desc: "The Front is the only way our nation will survive against enemies from within and without. The Fatherland Front will come to order the public life of our state and incorporate all aspects of society, for a safe and secure state. Furthermore we will cooperate with like minded states abroad to form a strong military front. The Fatherland Front today is the beating heart of our nation."

RHI_sammlungspolitik: "Sammlungspolitik"
RHI_sammlungspolitik_desc: "While the Kaiser was incompetent, there is one policy of his that we see use for: Sammlungspolitik. We need to unite the people and parties under one banner to push the German goals. Against socialist rhetoric and against those who make us weak."

RHI_the_right_values: "Heighten Anti-Socialist Rhetoric"
RHI_the_right_values_desc: "The socialist beast is not one you can kill with a sword, but with words. Informing the people against the dangers of the socialist hydra, we can entrench the traditional German society against all foes. Whenever the Hydra appears, a pen should be able to stop it, and the press should be able to kill it."

RHI_empower_reactionary_zentrum: "Support Reactionaries in Zentrum"
RHI_empower_reactionary_zentrum_desc: "Whilst Schleicher is not detested by those in Zentrum, he most certainly lacks support. His centralist tendencies have not struck a chord with the many federalists in the party. However, the Prussian wing led by Franz von Papen has proven amenable to Schleicher, granting us an excellent opportunity."

RHI_align_national_socialists: "Assimilate Patriotic Social Democrats"
RHI_align_national_socialists_desc: "While most of the Social Democrats can't be trusted, there are some willing to follow the example of the SPD members who supported the war. By making some token concessions, we can bring them into the fold."

RHI_lip_service_promises: "Lip Service Programs"
RHI_lip_service_promises_desc: "To make sure that the workers cooperate with us and to prevent any unnecessary strikes, we should make sure to make some popular worker oriented programs and reforms. Most of the common people are satisfied if their basic needs are met and those few ideological radicals can then be safely ignored. Simple reforms should be easy to implement at a minimal cost and prevent larger issues like strikes or even support for left-wing movements."

RHI_align_big_business: "Align Big Business"
RHI_align_big_business_desc: "The Industrialists so far were rather sympathetic to our cause, since we ended the French occupation. After all, the Valkists in their attitude to the economy are barely better than Marxists. However so far most of the big businesses were reluctant to support us due to the instability and questionable character of our government. But since these problems are not a given anymore we should pursue these business ties and align these people with our goals."

RHI_former_dnvp_connections: "Utilize Reactionary Allies"
RHI_former_dnvp_connections_desc: "It is well known that not all right wing movements favor the Valkists, there was an active right wing opposition to Dressler going back as far as Ludwig von Kahr’s rebellion in Bavaria. Many of them are from the old elites, higher society or even the army and would therefore surely make good allies as long as we can keep them under control."

RHI_incorporate_schutzvereine: "Integrate the Schützenverein"
RHI_incorporate_schutzvereine_desc: "What is currently a civilian sporting activity, could be useful for our in depth defence strategy and further militarisation of society. We should encourage the participation and strong local traditions of these organisations and allocate some funds to them. If we professionalise them, they could help us to generally introduce people to weaponry, combat and comradery without an overt military draft. Someone who has held a gun before is more useful for our cause."

RHI_use_monarchist_imagery: "Use Monarchist Imagery"
RHI_use_monarchist_imagery_desc: "The monarchy, whilst weak and frail, still had a surprisingly large number of supporters. The nationalism it created was also surprising, even in the Weimar, the German Empire and its institutions left a mark on the people. The uniforms, the military, the glory of the Prussian army. All of these were factors, but all attributed to the monarchy, we shouldn’t let this go to waste. Using the monarchy as a propaganda tool is merely how the boat in Germany goes."

RHI_end_liberals: "Suppress Liberal Opposition"
RHI_end_liberals_desc: "The liberals, idealist opportunists, those who even if unwillingly, made our nation weaker. These voices still echo after Weimar, even though their organisation should’ve burned with the failing democracy."

RHI_repudiate_versailles: "Denounce Versailles"
RHI_repudiate_versailles_desc: "Versailles, the absolute horrid treaty imposed upon us after our embarrassing defeat in the Great War. The treaty has made us weak, vulnerable, and economically, politically, and militarily defeated. We shall outright denounce this treaty as a symbol of Allied expansionism and selfishness, Deutschland Uber Alles!"

RHI_rule_by_decree: "Rule By Decree"
RHI_rule_by_decree_desc: "In times like these, the democratic principles have proven to be unsuitable, we have seen where the ineptitude of the Weimar Republic has led us. We should follow the ideas of Schleicher and Papen and establish a state of emergency to quickly pass legislation without any lengthy process. The parliament already supports our government anyways."

RHI_loyal_bureaucracy: "Secure the Bureaucracy"
RHI_loyal_bureaucracy_desc: "Bureaucracy is an old way of organisation, meant to stop corruption. However, with the expansion of bureaucracy, more and more people, with different opinions can become important suits, so reforms, even without the taint of corruption, can get stopped and delayed. To prevent anti-German bureaucracy, we should take matters into our own hands, and place the pawns at the table, right at the queen."

RHI_loyal_officer_clique: "Empower Loyal Officers"
RHI_loyal_officer_clique_desc: "Ever since the creation of our new government, we have failed to adequately compensate those who have always stood at the side of the German nation and her people. This will no longer be the case - our brothers-in-arms deserve their long awaited promotions."

RHI_centralize_control: "Remove All Roadblocks"
RHI_centralize_control_desc: "As much as we would like to ensure our reign holds strong, we simply do not have the absolute power at our disposal to do so. To this end, we must ensure all control in the Reich falls into our hands - lest we allow regions to break away and risk Germany’s security."

RHI_arrest_ringleaders: "Arrest Communist Ringleaders"
RHI_arrest_ringleaders_desc: "It appears that the communists have made small gains following the fall of the illegitimate Berlin government. If there was one thing we could agree with the traitors of 1932 on, it was the danger of the communists - who shall not remain free for much longer!"

RHI_authoritarian_republic: "Beyond Weimar's Anarchy"
RHI_authoritarian_republic_desc: "The anarchy of the old republic has demonstrated that democracy is fickle and that we cannot risk the danger of allowing revolutionaries from the left and the right to infest the republic. If the new Germany is to endure, we must ensure that only the constructive parties of the center will bring Germany forward."

RHI_wehrstaat: "The Wehrstaat"
RHI_wehrstaat_desc: "It's clear the only way to protect Germany from radicalism is if guided by the military. All institutions shall be subordinated to the needs of the army and the war effort. Furthermore, spiritual defence of the nation should also be organised under an all encompassing ideal of war. Together we will weather the storm for a new dawn of Germany."

RHI_papens_new_state: "Adopt the New State"
RHI_papens_new_state_desc: "The inept parliamentary system shall not be for much longer. Instead, a strong executive president shall lead, supported by experts who shall end the bickering that threatens Germany’s happiness. Whilst the restoration of the monarchy is our final goal, the situation must develop further. Until then, we will rule with an empowered President under these principles."

RHI_germany_lives_on: "Deutschland Lebt Und Marschiert Weiter!"
RHI_germany_lives_on_desc: "Germany has survived many crises in the past, has always found its way back and always adapted itself to the circumstances. No Varus, No Napoleon and no Dressler were able to change this. The Germany we have forged, like the second Reich is forged by blood and iron and our ancestors smile upon us for we have secured a new dawn for the idea of a united German Reich."

RHI_republican_vanguard: "The Republican Vanguard"
RHI_republican_vanguard_desc: "There has always only been one stalwart of decency and morality in the age of the decadent republic - the army. The Reichswehr is faithful to the national cause and understands that neither rabid revolution nor rotten reaction is suitable for Germany."

RHI_expand_secret_service: "Expand the Secret Service"
RHI_expand_secret_service_desc: "While on the surface distasteful, the Valkist secret  police was an efficient machine. Perhaps it could be repurposed and certain members pardoned?"

RHI_enable_the_reformers: "A Heer Above Politics"
RHI_enable_the_reformers_desc: "From its inception the German military has dictated internal and foreign policy, disregarding the needs of the people at every turn. The only way to save Germany is to depoliticize the Heer."

RHI_bring_back_fronde: "Release the Valkists"
RHI_bring_back_fronde_desc: "There is a line of thought in the old Reichswehr that Germany must engage in a total war for victory in the next war and that the Reichswehr ought to be the bastion of German nationalism and loyalty. Even though many of these officers sadly remained loyal to the wicked Valkists, they can be rehabilitated and brought back to make Germany mighty once again."

RHI_oath_of_loyalty: "Mandate Oaths of Loyalty"
RHI_oath_of_loyalty_desc: "Thankfully, our devalkification has shown these officers the errors of their ways. They have seen what Valkism would do to their minds, along with the repercussions it will bring to our neighbors. Today, we demand that these men renounce their previous beliefs and pledge their loyalty to the state."

RHI_schleiching_foreign_policy: "The New World"
RHI_schleiching_foreign_policy_desc: "The new world that we find ourselves in is far different than the one that Schleicher and his allies once worked in. With new powers on the rise and old ones receding, the time has come for Germany to make its play."

RHI_demobilize_the_nation: "Demobilize the Nation"
RHI_demobilize_the_nation_desc: "During the time of the Valkists, they have been preparing for war against Europe and possibly, the rest of the world. We shouldn’t let that happen because if we do, every man, woman, and child would die for those fools. We should immediately halt production of all military equipment lest we give foreign powers a reason to march towards Berlin."

RHI_appease_foreign_powers: "Appease the Western Powers"
RHI_appease_foreign_powers_desc: "With the rise of the Valkists, France and Britain have become wary of the powderkeg that would explode. For now, we’re able to show them that we’re on our way to creating a peaceful society. If they’re eager for more proof, we’re more than willing to grant them reasonable concessions and rebuild the trust that we have for the good of all."

RHI_prioritize_recovery: "Begin the Great Restoration"
RHI_prioritize_recovery_desc: "After the war, our people suffer that their livelihood has been destroyed. We must rebuild our buildings and foster the lives that were spared in creating a peaceful Rhineland. Our Great Restoration begins now!"

RHI_ride_the_valkist_wave: "Ride the Militarist Wave"
RHI_ride_the_valkist_wave_desc: "The Valkists and their gaggle of crazed thugs were often wrong in many different aspects, but they were right about the importance of a military arsenal. The wave of militarism that swept Germany during the feeble republican era was a great boon to Germany’s stature in the world and we must ride this as far as we can."

RHI_rebuild_mil_factories: "Rebuild Armament Capacity"
RHI_rebuild_mil_factories_desc: "Even though we have given peace a chance, it is with great misfortune that war is coming to our doorstep. Luckily, our factories stand ready to create our weapons. The time has come for the German people to unite against our common enemy."

RHI_prepare_for_more_war: "Maximize War Preparations"
RHI_prepare_for_more_war_desc: "While we stand ready for the oncoming war, there are still many things we can do to ensure that we are fully prepared. Building forts, creating more factories, mobilizing our forces, we have to maximize what we have so that our nation is ready for the upcoming onslaught. Never again shall we be unprepared for the upcoming war!"

RHI_open_industrial_contacts: "Reopen Industrial Contacts"
RHI_open_industrial_contacts_desc: "It would be folly to not enlist the aid of the industrial cartels. It's time to schedule a meeting with the various arms companies to see how best to militarise the economy."

RHI_militarized_autarky: "Militarized Autarky"
RHI_militarized_autarky_desc: "Sustaining the country is a hard task, but it is even harder to maintain and sustain an army. A militarized society prepared for such hardship will not falter in such a situation. For that, we need to militarize our sustenance, to militarize how we act and how we farm, discipline through the whole nation is required and shall be made."

RHI_allgemeine_gewerkschaft: "Unite the Trade Unions"
RHI_allgemeine_gewerkschaft_desc: "The trade unions are vulnerable to socialist influence if left to their own devices. Merging all unions into a national trade union would enable us to address the needs of workers, but keep them under close watch."

RHI_nationalize_important_industry: "Nationalize Important Industries"
RHI_nationalize_important_industry_desc: "Some industries such as coal and steel are too important to be left in private hands. Everything must be subordinated to the needs of the Heer. We cannot risk the cancer that is war profiteering."

RHI_rapid_industrial_expansion: "Rapid Industrial Expansion"
RHI_rapid_industrial_expansion_desc: "Currently, industrial output is woefully inadequate. The great factories must expand, for the well-being of the fatherland and for the world to witness Germany’s return to ascendancy."

RHI_create_corporatist_order: "The German Corporatist Order"
RHI_create_corporatist_order_desc: "The socialists gladly divide and exploit Germans through class warfare, and the industrialists, if left unchecked, would gladly sell out their countrymen if given the chance. Only class cooperation can protect the workers and prevent fifth columnists from tampering with German unity."

# Ideas
RHI_french_reparations: "French Reparations"
RHI_french_reparations_desc: "Ever since the Great War, Paris has imposed their demands for our resources as reparations, coal, steel, industrial products, grain - everything they could benefit from. The economic burden has brought much misery to the new state and it is a main goal for every faction to end this arrangement"
RHI_political_powderkeg: "Political Powderkeg"
RHI_political_powderkeg_desc: "The [RHI.GetName] since its establishment is an unstable puppet regime solely serving French interests. Political factionalism and radicalism is rampant and only French troops as well as the french funded Schutztruppen are able to keep order. Nationalists aim for reunification, socialists want to overthrow the military bourgeois government and the Rhenish separatists want to establish a free Rhenish state. Only the recent rise of Dressler and the influx of democrat refugees as somewhat galvanized support for the young state. Still, nobody is satisfied with the status quo and the French military government is aware that a single spark is enough for violence to erupt again."
RHI_rhenish_disarment: "[RHI.GetAdjective] Disarmament"
RHI_rhenish_disarment_desc: "After the Great War, the Rhineland was put under the military protection of [FRA.GetName] and Belgium. Only the separatist Schutztruppe, proposed by the civilian advisors was funded by the French army. With ongoing occupation becoming increasingly unfeasible, the question for Rhenish rearmament became a major topic."
RHI_rhenish_schutztruppen: "[RHI.GetAdjective] Schutztruppen"
RHI_rhenish_schutztruppen_desc: "The Schutztruppen are the heart of the Rhenish separatist movement, similar to the Freikorps or Communist militias in Germany, they are a paramilitary and political movement, fighting for their own political goals, mainly a independent Rhineland, although internally disunited over the nature of the Rhenish state, some merely favoring a split from Prussia within the German Empire while others favor a West German Republic as part of a loose alliance of German states. One thing is clear however, the Schutztruppe, as cruel and radical as they might be are the only force besides the French that can keep order"

#Events

# Where it started

rhein.0.t: "The Frontier of Democracy"
rhein.0.d: "As a new year dawns on the Rhineland, many a Rhinelander feel a great foreboding. The rise of Dressler in Berlin has seemingly ended any possibility for simple and peaceful reunification with the Reich and the French clearly have no desire to vacate their crown prize from the Great War.\n\nSo who will lead the Rhenish people into liberty and freedom? Many say that it is the local Rhinelanders - those who will stand up for the common man in Koblenz, Aachen and Köln. Even if they are splintered as of now, many say that their dreams of a free Rhineland is the dream to follow, one where Prussia will never again subjugate the free states of Germany.\n\nOr maybe not? Others argue that these Rhenish agitators and politicians only remain relevant due to the machinations of French imperialism. Many bemoan the mandate that they equate to the puppet confederation established by Napoleon; their loyalty is to the old Germany, a Germany that was once free and democratic. The 'Weimarers' consist of exiled democrats, fleeing from the increasingly tyrannical and aggressive Dressler regime. These groups of course have little love for the separatists, as well as the French who reciprocate in kind. After all, how can these former rivals of France be trusted with the intensely valuable Rhine? Not to mention how they had previously abandoned their supposed people to their fate under French domination; they do not find many friends outside of the British and American sectors.\n\nSo what will the Rhine's fate be? The mandate lives on borrowed time, so now the only question remaining is one of loyalty..."
rhein.0.a: "Is this the mandate's last year?"
RHI_adenauer_is_king: "§CAs the leading politician in the Rhineland, Konrad Adenauer will remain as the dominant force in Rhenish politics. It will take a serious shake-up for him to be legitimately threatened by the other factions.§!"
RHI_strengthen_who: "§Y[RHI_strengthen_who_check] will have their power [RHI_up_down_pwelect] [RHI_magnitude_pwelect]§!"
RHI_strengthens_republicans: "§RThe Republicans§!"
RHI_strengthens_seperatists: "§GThe Separatists§!"
RHI_strengthens_adenauer: "§CThe Centre§!"

rhein.1.t: "A Dysfunctional Economy"
rhein.1.d: "Many things are not normal in the mandate, most especially following the rise of Dressler and the subsequent isolation of the Rhineland from its historical German government. One thing however that has not remained normal since the mandate’s establishment is its economy - or rather its exploitation.\n\nHaving decisively beaten the Germans in the Great War, the Entente would take the opportunity to dictate to the Germans a peace treaty that was viewed with utter contempt by the Germans. With the Rhineland having been granted to France, chaos would soon erupt on the Rhine with French troops moving in to claim their part of the peace. This however would not last and soon the chaos prompted the establishment of a military council and shortly after a mandate, a humiliating affair for any German.\n\nOver the course of the next two decades, the mandate would hobble along, with its very being having dealt severe blows to the bonds within the Entente. With the French desiring to secure their borders, the mandate would find itself bleeding manpower and capital whilst the numerous industries on the Rhine would be weakened by the wanton plunder of soldiers, low market access and a domineering approach by the French in the mandate would see the Rhenish economy brought to its lowest point yet...\n\nAnd as the mandate enters another year, many wonder how on earth the economy will function again. How much longer can the once prosperous Rhine bleed until it turns white? With the French blowing all their credibility away and the other powers seemingly too weak to solve the continuous crisis, there is only one party that benefits from this sad state of affairs - Berlin."
rhein.1.a: "This will have to do..."

rhein.2.t: "Valkism on Trial"
rhein.2.d: "As a foreign mandate imposed by the victors of the Great War, one may expect at least some level of nationalist activity by the Germans. With the rise of Valkism in Germany, this has naturally led to Valkist groups within the mandate attempting to subvert the mandate such that Germany will be able to easily take back control of the mandate. Having been apprehended amidst their attempt to commit violent terrorist acts in the mandate, some valkists have now gone on trial.\n\nOn one hand, these valkists are undeniably culpable for their attempt to inflict terror and damage upon the Rhenish people for their ideology. Many former exiles from the Reich even demand their execution to serve as a warning for any would-be valkists, arguing that their deaths will ultimately save the lives of many more people. On the other hand, such a move would most certainly be treated as an extremely belligerent move by Berlin and would spike tensions even more, not to mention the rather extreme punishment for their failed terror attacks. In the end, the court finds..."
rhein.2.a: "...the defendant guilty on some charges, imprisonment recommended."
rhein.2.b: "...the defendant guilty on all charges, death sentence recommended."

rhein.3.t: "The Allies of the Inter-Allied Mandate"
rhein.3.d: "Whilst the French may be the main actor on the Inter-Allied council, they are not alone on it. With France’s concession of the Rhineland denied, the Entente opted to set-up a council made up of the Allied forces, with the council being tasked with running the mandate’s day-to-day affairs. On the council are not only French, but American, British and Belgian officials, all backed up with their national forces.\n\nHolding the most interest in the Rhineland, the French have undoubtedly made their presence felt, leading to resentment by the remaining Allies within the mandate of Paris’s hubris. Fearing encirclement by a pro-French state and France itself, the Belgians have maintained support for Josef Smeets and his \"Rhenish Republican People’s Party\", hoping to cleave the separatist movement from the French.\n\nHowever, not every mandate member desires to support the separatist movement. Having little sympathy with the French-backed separatists, the Anglo members of the mandate have found themselves well-courted by the \"Weimarers\" who desire to restore democracy to not just the Rhineland, but all of Germany. With the mandate still struggling with inter-allied squabbles, we must decide if we should grant the other allies some ground to operate or if France should take precedence - being the main source of funding and manpower for the mandate."
rhein.3.a: "Let's not rock the boat shall we?"
rhein.3.b: "Without France, there would be no mandate!"

rhein.4.t: "The Spectre Haunting Europe"
rhein.4.d: "Unfortunately like any other country, we suffer from the scourge of collectivism. Having always proved a grave nuisance to the mandate government since its establishment in 1919, the KPD and its cursed derivatives have always harassed and impeded our objectives in the Rhineland. Even after their inglorious flight from the Reich in 1932, the communists have still served as a thorn in our side, agitating even though we have mostly left them alone.\n\nWith a terror plot of theirs having been foiled and the ringleaders caught, we now have the choice to place them on trial or to simply rid ourselves of them through imprisonment and execution. Whilst the latter option is most certainly one typical of the mandate, perhaps it may do us well to show some leniency now? With the mandate teetering on the edge of collapse, maybe mercy ought to be in the cards?"
rhein.4.a: "We must purge them entirely!"
rhein.4.b: "They have just as much right to a fair trial as anyone else."

rhein.5.t: "Refugees from Germany"
rhein.5.d: "Ever since the catastrophe of 1932, the terror of the Valkist regime and their squad of reactionary thugs and noble goons have made themselves more evident. With their brutal suppression of any form of resistance, many Germans, realizing their love for liberty have opted to flee, mainly to the West where salvation may lay in Washington, London and Paris. However, most of them have soon found themselves here, whether through deportation or invitation by their fellow German exiles.\n\nEven if they prefer it here than in the mandate, many German refugees arrive with nothing. Many were forced to flee without any time to prepare nor protect their belongings from the tyrants in Berlin. As German refugees continue to collect in the mandate, their living conditions have grown dire to say the least. With many Germans finding this upsetting, there has been a common call to at least take some measures to aid the victims of Valkist terror. Such actions however may only embolden the separatists, who may frame such actions as further proof of the Rhineland’s ruination at the hands of Prussian lowlifes."
rhein.5.a: "Upsetting, but there is little we can do."

rhein.6.t: "The Creation of Rheinische Rundfunk AG"
rhein.6.d: "Even if the mandate has often stalled progress, it most certainly has not prevented it. With the mandate council finally allowing for a radio broadcasting station in the Rhineland, it would not be long before a broadcasting station would be set up across the entire Rhineland.\n\nBroadcasting music as well as general entertainment, the RRAG has also become admired and hated for its hosting of political debates and socio-political lectures. Allowing moderate republicans and separatists to debate at certain times, RRAG has inspired further political activity within the mandate. Whilst this has undoubtedly led to a strengthening of anti-Valkist sentiment within the Rhineland, some in the mandate government fear just what a tool may mean for the mandate’s future."
rhein.6.a: "We shall see."

rhein.7.t: "The London Crash"
rhein.7.d: "In a disastrous turn of events, the London stock market has crashed. Though most of us expected there to be some form of economic downturn as a result, the results have proven near-catastrophic for us. With all of the mandate’s backers now suffering some form of economic crisis, the mandate’s economy has taken a turn for the worse as unemployment skyrockets once again."
rhein.7.a: "Gott, hilf uns!"

rhein.8.t: "The Second Koblenz Government"
rhein.8.d: "With the London crash and subsequent economic depression, many Rhenish workers have once more found themselves without a job. Many turn to the radicals, who promise revolution from both left and right; but more than ever, they turn to the separatist movement.\n\nGaining widespread traction from the masses of discontented, unemployed workers, the separatist movements have seized the chance and have declared a government of their own in Koblenz. Aided and abetted by the French troops occupying the area, this new Koblenz government threatens our regime and now seem to be readying themselves to rule beyond Koblenz."
rhein.8.a: "Bah!"

rhein.9.t: "The Anglo Response"
rhein.9.d: "With the mandate’s continuation now doubtful, the Allied mandate council has opted to continue their infighting and bickering - the only difference being the subject. Believing that the mandate’s undemocratic nature and French heavy-handedness to be responsible for the mandate’s current unrest, London and Washington have called for elections to be held in the mandate to help determine the fate of the Rhineland.\n\nConsidering the general lack of electoral support for the separatists, such a call would undoubtedly undermine French influence in the future Rhineland. Besides, what would happen if the radicals experienced an electoral boon?"
rhein.9.a: "They may have a point..."
rhein.9.b: "What right do these cowards have to order us around?"

rhein.10.t: "The Costs of Occupation"
rhein.10.d: "Whilst the mandate government may not be long for this world, the costs of it most certainly are here. With the global economic crisis hitting the mandate’s runners hard, funds have been rapidly drying up for the mandate which could already only barely get by.\n\nPredictably, this has caused a stir in the mandate as the poor fiscal situation only continues to get worse - most especially with the French unable to help subsidize the occupation. This only leaves us with two options, either we raise taxes on the populace - likely leading to a surge of nationalism and massive protests in the streets or we reach out to Koblenz to help us collect funds - funds that they already need for themselves and are likely to collect for us through a massive wave of violence..."
rhein.10.a: "Raise the taxes!"
rhein.10.b: "Koblenz may have a solution for us."

rhein.11.t: "The Radical Surge"
rhein.11.d: "With the Rhine suffering from an economic crash, it was to be expected that extremists would come out of the woodwork to destabilize the mandate. Whether they be exiled communists or agents of Berlin, they agitate against the government and only act to make our situation worse.\n\nRather unfortunately, there are few options we can take. One option is to simply let the occupation troops deal with it as they have for the last few years, though this will inevitably only spark more discontent towards any foreign presence and stress the burden the occupation troops must deal with. Another option is to unleash the Schutztruppe onto the communists and Valkists, though their professional attitudes leave much to be desired..."
rhein.11.a: "The Schutztruppe shall deal with it!"
rhein.11.b: "The occupation troops will have to do..."

rhein.12.t: "The National Conference"
rhein.12.d: "The time has come. With the conference to be held today, the fate of the Rhineland will be determined with it. Many are on edge, for the Rhine is home to many liberty loving Germans. Not only that, it is home to those who would resist Valkist terror and tyranny until their last breath.\n\nAnd so it began. With all delegates giving their speeches, the division within the Rhineland would be on full display. There were vicious arguments and rapturous applause. Nevertheless, the conference proceeded onwards and soon, a vote would be made. A vote that would determine the Rhineland’s fate. The vote that may even decide Germany’s fate."
rhein.12.a: "Let us see..."

rhein.13.t: "The Separatist Triumph"
rhein.13.d: "Ever since the inglorious end of the Hohenzollern’s empire, the Rhineland has rarely experienced a particularly stable government. Whether it be the failures of 1919 or 1923, the Rhenish separatists have always failed to truly hold onto power.\n\nThis has changed.\n\nWith their victory in the national conference, the Rhineland appears to be due for a future where it is wholly separate from Prussia, and maybe even the Reich. But such a course comes with strings attached; how could the small, young state of the Rhine survive Germany’s obvious ambitions? Behind the separatist curtain of independence lies French influence, so overreaching that some may even believe it to be French control. A separatist Rhineland is not merely one opposed to Germany, but one allied to France.\n\nAnd so it shall be..."
rhein.13.a: "A new dawn..."

rhein.14.t: "The Republican Triumph"
rhein.14.d: "With Germany’s prospects in the war having dimmed to the point of guaranteed defeat, the German people rose up. They rose up against the stupid and pointless fighting, creating a new republic. A republic that was unceremoniously disposed of in Dressler’s violent takeover.\n\n1932 will go down in history as the end of the first German republic, but [GetYear] shall be the year history remembers when the republic was reborn. Of course such an outcome seems as of now to be highly improbable, considering the relative lack of enthusiasm on the part of Paris as well as Berlin’s increased ire at our existence. Our victory would thus be one to remember - assuming it even happens.\n\nNevertheless, so it shall be..."
rhein.14.a: "A new dawn..."

rhein.15.t: "The Tale of Three Rhinelanders"
rhein.15.d: "As expected, separatist success at the national conference has not been well-received by some. With the republicans up in arms about what they view as France’s victory in the Rhineland, not even general opposition can stop the separatists from having internal rivalries.\n\nNow the decision is which separatist groups deserve the reigns of power. The most deserving many would say is Konrad Adenauer. As the longtime mayor of Cologne and the leader of the catholic Centre in the former mandate, Adenauer has gained a reputation for being rather competent as well as pragmatic. With the French likely to remain, many believe that Paris is ready to cut a deal with Adenauer instead of putting their trust into their old horse.\n\nSo who exactly were these horses? Coming to prominence through their separatist actions, Josef Matthes and Hans Adam Dorten are both hardcore separatists, hateful of Prussia and strongly backed by the French. Unfortunately, they have accrued a less than stellar reputation, not least because of their tendency to waste the many French-provisioned opportunities and for their general lack of popularity and experience in the Rhenish political landscape.\n\nYet giving up on them would admit a massive failure on Paris’s part since the beginning of the mandate, and would most certainly rile the French far-right into a frenzy over Dorten’s supposed betrayal. Still, surely some sort of solution can be made?"
rhein.15.a: "The mayor is the man for the job!"
rhein.15.b: "We do not forget our friends."

rhein.16.t: "November on the Rhine"
rhein.16.d: "The victory of the republicans at the national conference has not been met with universal acclaim. The French reaction has been at best muted and the press has entered hysterics about how the Rhineland will soon be handed over to the \"Boche\" in Berlin.\n\nOf course such claims are obviously laughable. Most especially with the formation of an unlikely alliance. Fearing the potential return of the old Weimar government to the Rhineland, Dorten and Matthes have shocked the political realm by announcing their mutual cooperation. Whilst such an alliance may be enough to grant them rulership over the Rhine, they are only able to do so at the behest of the \"Weimarers\" - the real winners of the national conference.\n\nWith their claim to power legitimately strengthened, the republicans who fled from Germany have made their presence known to the whole world. They certainly experience plenty of support from London and Washington, who feel that their willingness to restore democracy to the Rhineland and maybe even Germany is an admirable thing. Even Paris seems ready to turn around and support the republican government. After all, what would be more fatal for the Valkist regime than a rival democratic government?\n\nStill, the Rhine’s true fate will be decided not by Berlin, nor Paris but by the Rhenish people. The workers, farmers and businessmen of the once-prosperous Rhine must now make their decision, for the true inheritor of the republic..."

rhein.17.t: "The French Withdrawal"
rhein.17.d: "The end of the mandate was to be expected, but the rather abrupt nature of the withdrawal most certainly was not. With their victory in the national conference, the republican government would soon find itself lacking in Paris’s backing. With the withdrawal of Allied troops, the mandate would soon become the former mandate as the cheers of the native Germans could be heard from Aachen to Speyer.\n\nEven if the fate of free Germany remains uncertain beyond the single year protection period, for now we can celebrate."

rhein.18.t: "The German Menace"
rhein.18.d: "It seems that despite our wish to remain undisturbed by Berlin, they always find a way to undermine us. Reports have indicated that agitation in the mandate has increased to an unprecedented point, which combined with the surge in foreign agents from Germany suggest that there is more than simply a nationalist wave amongst the Rhinelanders."
rhein.18.a: "Curse those goose stepping bastards!"

rhein.19.t: "The End of the Line"
rhein.19.d: "The mandate will not see the next year.\n\nThis is now an unmistakable truth. With the chaos of the crash now unravelling the mandate more and more, the mandate powers have agreed to end the mandate. Such a course of action however led to further conflict, with the mandate powers disagreeing on how to best withdraw from the Rhineland. Would not a defenseless Rhineland be easy prey for the Germans?\n\nSo it was decided. A national conference for the fate of the Rhineland was to be held, where the competing factions would be able to make themselves heard. This way, the Rhineland would surely not fall into catastrophe once Allied forces withdraw. From then on, the Rhine would thus be able to stand on its own two feet."
rhein.19.a: "Not yet..."

rhein.20.t: "Chaos on the Rhine"
rhein.20.d: "As destiny and history along with it roll on, another historical injustice now readies to correct itself. Our spies in the disgusting imperialist Rhenish mandate have reported that a national conference is to be held, one where the foreign puppets of London and Paris dictate how best to dress up the Entente’s continued exploitation of the Rhineland.\n\nHowever, this also provides an opportunity. Our comrades in the mandate are itching for a moment to ensure that the Rhine returns to Germany. To obtain this, we would do well to ensure that until the Rhine is liberated, the false regime will never know rest!"
rhein.20.a: "This is our chance!"

rhein.21.t: "The End of the Mandate"
rhein.21.d: "With a new Rhenish government soon to be established, the mandate would draw its last breath. At [GetDateText], the Inter-Allied mandate would officially end. The Rhineland was now free.\n\nOf course such a statement fails to appreciate the reality of the situation on the ground. Whilst the Rhine may officially be free, the continued presence of French troops and the continued backing of France for the separatists have not gone unnoticed. In fact, some analysts in America and Britain have decried the withdrawal as simply handing over the Rhineland to an ambitious and vengeful France. How could they betray the Rhineland to French imperialism? In spite of this foreign judgement, few would disagree that the Rhine has never been freer than ever before."

They claim that should we invest into them, we will be able to receive back our money's worth ten-fold or more as they promise to help us in containing the revisionist powers, wherever they may be. However, this may not be so worthwhile considering their rather vulnerable geographical position."

rhein.24.a: "So be it."

rhein.25.t: "The Problem of Reparations"
rhein.25.d: "In the aftermath of the Great War, we earned ourselves some recompense for all the destruction that the Germans unleashed via rightfully harsh reparations. These reparations were vital to our economic situation, enabling us to repay Washington and for us to rebuild after the war. However, the young German republic sabotaged our every effort to extract what we were owed - leading to the current events of today.\n\nNow, the Rhenish government has come to us requesting to renegotiate and ultimately lower that which is required of them. Even though such a change may spark some public outcry here, it will be vital to our Rhenish ally's recovery, especially important in today's uncertain times."
rhein.25.a: "They need to stand on their own."

rhein.28.t: "Economic Cooperation with the Rhine?"
rhein.28.d: "With our allies having secured themselves on the Rhine, it seems that they have now come to Paris asking for deeper economic cooperation between us and them. This is most certainly a triumph for French diplomacy as it now opens the gateway for access to the lucrative Rhenish resources that would grant us a huge advantage against the Germans and secure our position on the continent."

rhein.28.b: "We are doing just fine on our own."

rhein.29.t: "Towards Economic Unity"
rhein.29.d: "As expected, [FROM.GetName] has accepted our request for deeper economic cooperation. This will not only help us to recover from the crash that plunged the Rhine into catastrophe, but will also let us slowly but surely work towards true peace in Europe - once the Valkist beast has been slain of course."
rhein.29.a: "Great!"

rhein.30.a: "How are they so blind?"

rhein.35.t: "A Withdrawal Plan?"
rhein.35.d: "What shall be the new course of action for the mandate this year? With the mandate appearing ever tenuous, the prospect of the mandate’s end and the withdrawal of Entente forces from the Rhineland has become ever more likely. Of course, many domestic political groups oppose such a thing for they fear it would be a matter of time before the Rhineland is then retaken by the German government in Berlin who despises both French collaborators and the Weimar exiles.\n\nThis then leaves us with two options. A withdrawal plan would allow for a measured, organized and efficient withdrawal of forces from the Rhineland, which would also be well-appreciated once the time comes. This especially has been pushed for by the separatist movement which desires an orderly transition of power for a free Rhineland to their hands. On the other hand, preparing for withdrawal would indicate that the Rhineland was open for the taking, or for some the \"liberation\" as Berlin may put it. This has caused the \"Weimarer\" camp to be highly opposed to any notion of withdrawal, for the Rhineland must remain protected and serve as a beacon of German freedom."
rhein.35.a: "It is the best course of action."

rhein.35.a.tt: "§lThis will make the economic transition easier once the mandate comes to an end§!"

rhein.36.t: "The Fate of the Equipment"
rhein.36.d: "There are many equipment stores in the Rhineland, with both dated and modern rifles, machine guns and artillery pieces among other things that are to be readied in the scenario of a German attack. To be sure, the modernization of the Rhineland arsenal in preparation for a potential German attack has become an ever more popular talking point among the mandate’s directors, with the French and Belgians urging for the Rhineland to be turned into a bastion against which Valkist aggression cannot pass.\n\nWith an impending withdrawal however, such a matter has become a simply impractical possibility. While the modernization of the existing equipment stores in the Rhineland has ended, there have been some debates as to whether some equipment should be left behind for the local forces to use. Although it could fall into the hands of the Germans, supporters of such a position argue that the Rhinelanders must be given some ways to keep themselves free and independent of Prussian domination."
rhein.36.a: "Keep some in \"convenient\" places, for the future."
rhein.36.b: "Prepare it for return"
rhein.36.tt: "§lOnce the mandate's time is up, we will gain an additional £GFX_rifle_texticon §Y2500§! infantry equipment, £GFX_support_texticon §Y750§! support equipment and £GFX_artillery_texticon §Y750§! artillery equipment.§!"

rhein.37.t: "Meeting the Separatists"
rhein.37.d: "Despite the official ban on nearly all types of political activity within the Rhineland mandate, the separatist movement has always received a blind eye from the commission. After all, the goal of the separatists for a more distinct Rhenish culture can hardly be described as \"political\", at least if you ask the French or Belgian forces that guard their nations’ sectors.\n\nAs such, the meeting between the newly formed separatist government at Koblenz and the commission’s diplomats was far from tense. As cameras flashed and filmed the negotiations between the two sides, many were surprised at just how smoothly the entire negotiation process was. The Koblenz government would dissolve itself for the moment. In return, its leaders and the Schutztruppe were not only granted legal status to politically organize themselves without even a pretense of non-political motive, but the separatist movement would have its leaders enter the government as advisors for the new Rhineland to come. This has riled up not just Berlin, but even German nationalists in the mandate who see this as a betrayal of everything the mandate had promised - but who takes such people seriously?"
rhein.37.a: "That should wrap this up."

rhein.38.t: "Separatist Fury"
rhein.38.d: "When the commission declared that all funding for the separatist movement was to be halted, the expected outrage from the separatists was palpable. Mere hours following the declaration, both Dorten and Matthes have surprisingly released a joint message denouncing the mandate’s move as a total betrayal of the Rhineland and her people, with both calling for civil resistance against the government.\n\nPerhaps more unpleasantly, Dorten and Matthes have levied their most powerful asset - the French nationalist press. With French nationalists echoing Dorten’s screeds of betrayal, the French have decided to cut funding to the mandate as a whole - making our operations far more difficult. Still, this move could herald a collapse of the separatist movement as its dependency on French funding begins to make itself felt more and more."

Through the Rhineland’s liberation, the spirit of Lorelei will be unleashed and the Rhineland will be finally able to prosper away from Prussian tyranny!\n\nThings however are not so simple. Both Matthes and Dorten have many differences to work through, in fact some even believe that their differences are so great as to preclude any notion of cooperation between the two.\n\nWith the French having given the mother of all opportunities to the separatists to once and for all fulfil their promise of a free, anti-Prussian Rhineland, the first question that must now be answered is who will take preeminence? Who will be the first Ministerpräsident of the Rhenish Free State?"

In reaction to our recent actions, Dorten and his crew of bourgeois elitists have spoken out against us, denouncing us as crypto-bolsheviks and attempting to subvert the Rhenish revolution towards a puppet state ran by France and Belgium.\n\nEven if such accusations are patently absurd, this has only served to demonstrate the instability and disunity within the \"United\" movement. As long as Dorten remains as a thorn in our side who we are to work with, there is little we can do..."

rhein.separatist.5.d: "It seems that as we continue working towards a Rhenish republic free from Prussian influence and terror, there are those who would like to subvert our project. Due to our recent undertakings, socialists coalescing around Matthes and Smeets have decried us as effete bourgeois who are unable to really bring the average Rhinelander the relief they need. Some have even gone so far as to declare us puppets of Paris who seek to enslave the German people.\n\nWhilst such accusations are no doubt totally ridiculous and very rich coming from the Belgian Smeets and French Matthes, this has not shone a good light onto the movement as the \"United\" movement seems to reveal its true nature."
rhein.separatist.5.a: "Socialism is a disease."

rhein.separatist.6.t: "Dorten Vs. Matthes"
rhein.separatist.6.d: "It has happened.\n\nSince his rise to prominence in 1923, Josef Friedrich Matthes has always found himself at odds with Hans Adam Dorten. Both leaders of a movement enfeebled by its undesirable base, lack of genuine popular support and many mismanagements and bunglings. Where Dorten seeked to blame \"Prussian Agents\" for any failures, Matthes went further, sparking conspiracies of a supposed plot by Berlin to smash the Rhinelander’s spirits. When Dorten attempted to reach out to Zentrum, Matthes went full-speed ahead, bringing as many disaffected workers as he could to wreak havoc upon the separatist’s enemies. While Dorten was vacationing in Paris, Matthes would be shrieking cries of revolution from the dwindling movement.\n\nBut those days are over, now the two leaders found themselves in a position to exert influence. Even more magically, they succeeded at preventing the state’s destruction. But now another crisis approaches, seemingly ready to break the Rhenish movement once again. With a second national conference called to determine the fate of the movement, only one seems poised to come out on top.\n\nSo who will it be? Matthes has always been a firebrand, a blowhard whose main skill is at getting people to sue him. Meanwhile, Dorten has repeatedly failed to live up to the expectations placed on him by Paris and now our own people - all for him to simply blame Prussia for the Rhineland’s troubles. Furthermore, sectional differences have caused Matthes and Dorten to drift, with Dorten now finding succour in the middle-class and Matthes rallying the workers of the Rhineland to his cause. The only question now is who is more worthy as the Rhineland’s leaders."

rhein.separatist.7.d: "Expecting a sore loser like Dorten to take his loss well would be a fanciful wish indeed, but few expected what Dorten would do after denouncing Matthes and his victorious Independence League. Following his expected denunciations of Matthes as a rabble-rouser and crypto-bolshevik, Dorten would soon surprise everyone by calling the \"People’s Association\" faction within the VRB to split. Following his departure along with additional words on Prussian-induced betrayal, Smeet’s rump faction of Belgian-backed sycophants would also split at which point the \"United Rhineland Movement\" would only have Matthes remaining in it.\n\nWhilst undoubtedly a great blow to the legitimacy of the separatist movement, many also see it as an opportunity to finally give the Rhineland the leadership she needs for her revitalization. With Dorten resigning all his public offices, Wilhelm von Metzen, long-time ally of Matthes and the respectable, steady politician of the two has been made the new prime minister. With no reactionary nor bourgeois party to hinder them, the Independence League can finally begin building towards the Rhenish Republic."
rhein.separatist.7.dorten: "With his ties to big business and the off-putting nature of Matthes’s colleagues, Dorten found himself easily winning at the vote of the national conference. Defeated, Matthes would soon have no choice but to slink back to a secondary position within the separatist movement. Never one to let such a loss go unanswered, Matthes would soon fly into a furious rage towards Dorten, denouncing him as an incompetent reactionary and French tool. More worryingly however, Matthes would then go on to call for the \"Independence League\" faction within the VRB to split entirely. Not long after, Smeets and his crew of slavish-sycophants would also split from the movement, culminating in the death of the \"United Rhineland Movement\".\n\nWhilst this is undeniably a great blow to the legitimacy of the new free state, many have seen it as a golden chance. The chance for the people of the Rhineland to once and for all throw off the Prussian scum and liberate the Rhinelanders once and for all. With Matthes resigning all of his public offices, Hermann Klamt, a recent associate of Dorten and influential figure amongst the business classes would take the office of prime minister. Now, no one will oppose Dorten in his quest for the Rhineland’s freedom."

The weakest out of all three movements, the RVP now faces a difficult question; should they attempt to cooperate with Dorten or with Matthes?\n\nWhilst such a choice may seem rather simple due to Dorten’s anti-socialist leanings and Matthes’s socialist origins, the results of Matthes’s movement have proved disastrous for the RVP. Having lost many to defections due to dissatisfaction with Smeets’s dictatorial tendencies, the RVP simply exists as a rump socialist party, with its status as the third wheel in the movement being its unavoidable fate.\n\nOn the other hand, Dorten’s anti-socialism may prove useful in bringing back those who would seek to grant the Rhenish workers their revolution through independence. Naturally, Dorten will prove painful in the short term, but would it be better to fade into irrelevance than to risk it all for success?"

With our legitimacy still in shambles after ample time, the VRB has lost much momentum, now desperately chugging along only through its sheer inertia as the ruling party.\n\nOf course, this state of affairs has not gone unnoticed by our opposition. Realizing the opportunity that lay before them, the opposition leaders have collectively denounced [RHI.GetLeader] before demanding that we turn over power to them. With this obviously not due to happen, we can only wait and see what they will do next..."
rhein.separatist.10.a: "Curse those splitters!"

rhein.separatist.11.t: "The Rhenish Tragedy"
rhein.separatist.11.d: "Whilst many may have celebrated our grand victory at the Rhenish national conference in previous years, such celebrations have proved to be a tad early to say the least. Marred by infighting and a lack of legitimacy, the Koblenz government has undoubtedly bungled things massively in the Rhineland. Despite our near-endless support, the simple truth is that they have not acquitted themselves well to the task of government.\n\nSo what next? Most call for us to maintain support, but force an end to the infighting and ensure that the Rhineland remains loyal. Some hawks however call for a much riskier, but potentially much more beneficial approach. Having remained at the sidelines since the Koblenz government took hold, Konrad Adenauer could prove a much more competent figure to lead the Rhineland, potentially being more able to benefit our interests."
rhein.separatist.11.a: "A tragedy indeed..."
rhein.separatist.11.b: "Enough is enough!"

rhein.separatist.12.t: "Paris's Ire"
rhein.separatist.12.d: "Whilst the faltering separatist movement may have been obvious to most outside observers, one observer has only now taken notice of our rather unfortunate situation. Following some strongly worded telegrams and conversations, the French have indicated their willingness to continue backing us up, but at the cost of ending our internal squabbles.\n\nWhilst such a cost may not seem like a price to pay at all, it has only demonstrated the government’s ineffectual handling of the situation. With a second national conference due to be called, the only thing certain now is that the current government is bound to have a rough future ahead of it - assuming it even survives the conference that is."
rhein.separatist.12.a: "Great..."

rhein.separatist.13.t: "The End of the VRB"
rhein.separatist.13.d: "The unthinkable has happened. With Paris having become dissatisfied with our handling of the situation, it seems that they have opted to sell us out in favour of mayor of Cologne Konrad Adenauer. Once the kingmaker in the Rhineland, our inability to secure legitimacy has caused him to gain much power, turning him into the much preferred option for the French.\n\nWith French pressure demanding that we accede to Adenauer’s government, we have little choice. The only thing we can hope for is that things will not get worse from here on out..."
rhein.separatist.13.a: "So it came to this..."

rhein.separatist.14.t: "The Rhineland's Future"
rhein.separatist.14.d: "The time has come.\n\nWith the separatist movement having been embroiled in messy internal politics for far too long, the infighting has simply become too unbearable. With a continued coalition government demonstrating itself to be untenable, a national conference has been called, all to determine the future of the Rhineland."
rhein.separatist.14.a: "Let's get to it!"

rhein.separatist.15.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks for Independence"
rhein.separatist.15.d: "With our Rhenish ally continuing to entrench themselves, a bold request has come in today from Koblenz. In it, they ask for us to scale down our influence in the Rhineland and to effectively allow them to become independent. Whilst this is not necessarily a bad thing, hawks have railed against this as a ploy to land the Rhineland back into the hands of Germany."
rhein.separatist.15.a: "They already ARE free."
rhein.separatist.15.b: "They have earned their freedom."

rhein.separatist.16.t: "[FROM.GetName] refuses"
rhein.separatist.16.d: "Sadly, it appears that [FROM.GetName] has refused to grant us total independence, citing the current existence of the Valkist regime as a requirement for their continued protection of us. Whilst this is no doubt a misstep in the fight against Valkism, we can only leave this be until Germany is truly defeated."
rhein.separatist.16.a: "And to expect anything else from them..."

rhein.separatist.17.t: "[FROM.GetName] Releases Us"
rhein.separatist.17.d: "Surprisingly, [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has decided to leave us be, allowing us to step forth as an equal partner. This is without a doubt a great victory in our continued effort towards a free, independent Rhineland in a safer, more prosperous Europe."
rhein.separatist.17.a: "As they should."

rhein.separatist.18.t: "The Rhenish Triumph"
rhein.separatist.18.d: "With the fall of Germany, a fact has been made abundantly apparent - a free Rhineland is here to stay.\n\nEven in the tribulations of war, some still doubted the ability for the Rhenish state to withstand the Prussian menace. Even our allies abroad privately mocked us for being little more than a puppet of the French, but now no one can deny that the Rhineland is free and that it was to the courageous leadership of [RHI.GetLeader] that saw the remnants of a free German people through to the end of the war.\n\nWith the war now over, the separatist movement has received more legitimacy than ever. Former skeptics now praise the government and the view that we are little more than French puppets stands no longer. The spirit of Lorelei has truly been unleashed!"

rhein.separatist.19.d: "Unfortunately, it appears that the central government has strong views on our current government.

rhein.separatist.19.a: "For shame..."

# Adenauer

rhein.adenauer.0.t: "An Astonishing Promotion"
rhein.adenauer.0.d: "With the Centre having taken on the role as the Rhineland’s new leaders, there was much fear on what the status of the new government would be. Whilst going from the premier local political figure in the mandate to leader of the Rhineland may not seem like much of a change, it most certainly has become a cause of concern for the new Rhenish Free State. Although most of Zentrum in the now-former mandate desires to maintain the Rhineland’s independence from both the Prussians and the Parisians, separatism is not terribly popular and many still yearn for a free Rhineland in a free Germany.\n\nNevertheless, Adenauer and along with him Rhenish Zentrum now have the task of leading the new state forward. With the French having remained in the Rhineland at the request of Z, chief administrator of the Saarland, Joseph Louis Andlauer has taken the role as the liaison between the government and France with government positions having fallen into the hands of Zentrum. The long-time bastion of Zentrum during the years of the republic, many await with optimism and also dread the future that will await the newly born Rhenish state."

Even if the relationship between the Germans and Paris are fraught, we can rest easy knowing that the strongest army in Europe is here to guide our brave men in the preservation of the Rhineland’s freedom."
rhein.adenauer.1.a: "Let us work together towards democracy’s preservation!"

rhein.adenauer.2.t: "The Creation of the Verfassungsgericht"
rhein.adenauer.2.d: "With order finally reigning in the free republic, the time has come to neutralize the Rhineland from the many toxic extremists who are prepared to see to terror and death in preparation for their fanciful desires. With the consent of our allies, a new constitutional court has been established that will ensure only the constructive, democratic parties are allowed to organize in our young democracy instead of destructive and obstructionist radicals."
rhein.adenauer.2.a: "Let us uphold our democracy!"

rhein.adenauer.3.t: "The [RHI.GetAdjective] Diplomatic Mission to Paris"
rhein.adenauer.3.d: "As our diplomatic mission sets off for Paris, we have much to decide what shall be on the agenda. There are many things that we need from the French, but many disagree on what shall be the order of the day.\n\nSome say that we need to attain more freedom away from Paris - that is the loosening of their relative control over us. Others have demanded that we ask for our coal and steel to be back in our hands. Of course, some have also floated the suggestion that we simply request additional investments from the French, a proposal they are far more likely to accept."
rhein.adenauer.3.a: "Ask for more autonomy"

rhein.adenauer.4.d: "A Rhenish delegation has arrived in Paris today, meeting with our diplomats to negotiate over aid and assistance to their fledgling state. Amidst discussions for recognition among other usually expected niceties, the Rhenish delegation have made their aims abundantly clear.\n\n"
rhein.adenauer.4.da: "$rhein.adenauer.4.d$They have made their primary goal being greater independence. While this would be very well-appreciated by the Germans, many nationalists have decried this as a typical Teuton betrayal of our generosity and have urged us to reject their call and concede something less."
rhein.adenauer.4.db: "$rhein.adenauer.4.d$That goal would be for the turning over of resource rights to what they view as a legitimate German government that desires to work towards the ultimate achievement of peace in Europe. Although some hawks have warned against giving up such an advantage, most agree that it would be the first step towards a friendly Germany."
rhein.adenauer.4.dc: "$rhein.adenauer.4.d$The Rhenish have requested infrastructure development, a relatively small investment that could prove valuable in tying them to our sphere. Still, some have urged that we keep the resources at home instead."

rhein.adenauer.5.t: "The French Lifeline"
rhein.adenauer.5.d: "Today our request for a full-fledged alliance as well as support by the French was received by the French. Considering the continued presence of French troops and funds in the new Rhenish state, such matters were a formality.\n\nWhilst such a relationship with the French shall undoubtedly prove to be fruitful and the vital part of any strategy to resist Berlin's expansion, we must be wary of continuous French presence. Some even say that should there be too much of it, the anti-French section of the public will gain the strength to invite Prussia back into the Rhineland and cause the destruction of our democracy. Either way, we ought to tread lightly..."
rhein.adenauer.5.a: "So be it."

rhein.adenauer.6.t: "[FRA.GetNameDef] denies us!"
rhein.adenauer.6.d: "In a truly unfortunate turn of events, [FRA.GetNameDef] has opted to refuse us, thereby making the entire diplomatic mission a total waste of time. Worse, the press has caught wind of this betrayal and has in turn caused anti-French sentiments to spike to levels not seen since the crisis of 1923."
rhein.adenauer.6.a: "What a waste of time..."

rhein.adenauer.7.t: "Victory in the Second Great War"
rhein.adenauer.7.d: "Years have gone by since the takeover of Germany by the bestial tyrant known as Adam Dressler. In the meantime, leaders have risen and fallen - with the old Entente order now irrevocably different. Turning its eyes from innocent Germans towards the peoples of Europe, the Prussian menace found itself biting off far more than it could chew - the end result being the subjugation of the rest of Germany to death and destruction.\n\nNow we shall turn towards the new era. We have come out victorious in this war, the German people are free from Valkism and its gaggles of thugs. Whether the Rhineland is fated to be separate, or to take the other German states under its wing is anyone’s guess, but for now we can rest easy knowing that the existential terror of Europe has been vanquished."
rhein.adenauer.7.a: "We celebrate - and mourn."

rhein.adenauer.8.t: "Shifting Political Winds"
rhein.adenauer.8.d: "The appetite for separatism in the Rhineland has always been rather small, making it ironic that few movements are as divided as the Rhenish separatists. Formerly split between the left-leaning Independence League and the firmly bourgeois right-wing People’s Association, the takeover of the middle has caused the latter to slowly but surely lose its relevance.\n\nIt is hardly surprising that the conspiratorial, vain and often boisterous leader of the People’s Association, Hans Adam Dorten has withered away much of his support. Having never forgotten his supposed ‘betrayal’ at the hands of Adenauer in 1919, Dorten has regularly refused to cooperate with our government at every turn. This, combined with his loss of French favour, has not bode well for his movement as it began to haemorrhage supporters. The death of his movement has now been consecrated with its disbandment as supporters move towards the rump liberal movement, leaving only one truly separatist movement in the Rhineland."
rhein.adenauer.8.a: "He will not be missed."

# Republicans

rhein.republic.1.t: "The Ghost of Weimar"
rhein.republic.1.d: "With the rise of Dressler and the far-right in general in the east, the republic that arose from the declaration at Weimar on that cold day in 1919 has undeniably died. Many of course see its fate as inevitable, with the existing conclusion simply being amongst the most likely and desired fates of the German nation. However, the radical nature of Dressler and his thuggish leagues have propelled many Germans towards the wider world, with many ending up here out of personal or political reasons.\n\nOf course, many in the mandate still desire only to get by, but as the mandate’s days grow more numbered, many nervously anticipate the power vacuum that would follow any Allied withdrawal. Many put their faith in their local leaders, others opt to follow the French-backed separatists, but the new situation has emboldened a new faction - the  \"Weimarers\" as they are often denoted derisively or otherwise desire a return to the republic.\n\nHaving fled from the terror unleashed by the Valkist regime, they now operate within the Rhineland, agitating for the Rhineland to become the next bastion of German democracy. With the separatists commonly viewed as French hacks, this view has found undeniable popularity amongst sections of the Rhenish populace - sickened as they are by continued French presence in the Rhineland.\n\nOf course, their desire to return to the republican government has also sparked major pushback from leading Rhenish figures. Whether it be their icy disposition towards federalism, the fear that their rule will lead to another war or simply their narrow appeal, the republicans have much to do if they are to have a chance to resurrect the Germany of 1928."
rhein.republic.1.a: "Haven’t they failed once?"
  
rhein.republic.2.t: "Separatist Outrage"
rhein.republic.2.d: "Not all have taken our proclamation as the inheritors of the German republic well, vile separatist elements backed by the French have begun to attack and harass our forces at every corner. Whilst they are being dealt with swiftly and ruthlessly, this has still proven irritating with the entrenched Schutztruppe making cementing our rule more of a headache at every turn."
rhein.republic.2.a: "Have they considered not being traitors?"

rhein.republic.3.t: "The Second Burgfriedenspolitik"
rhein.republic.3.d: "As always, the social democrats have not proven particularly united on the issue of cooperation with the government. With our political truce with them in the face of Berlin's overwhelming strength, some leftists within the SPD have denounced the moderates for their willingness to cooperate with what they see as a corrupt republican government. Even though they have not outright rebelled against the government, they have not proven very receptive to any form of cooperation and have split from the social democrats in all but name."
rhein.republic.3.a: "Leftists have always been intransigent."
  
rhein.republic.4.t: "Kabinett Schleicher"
rhein.republic.4.d: "With great anticipation, Kurt von Schleicher has been reinstated as the rightful chancellor of what will soon-be the only Germany in the world. Although some have worries over Schleicher’s competence and beliefs, especially taking the catastrophe of 1932 into account, many have been eased by Schleicher’s promise to reign in the republic’s interests and to act as a caretaker chancellor until the republic can truly return to the people.\n\nNevertheless, Schleicher will not simply be granted the most powerful position in the government. As a military man at heart and with many rumours about his true aim for Germany abound, the republican council would not simply let Schleicher crown himself as some sort of supreme dictator. Opting to remain in place, the republican council has forced Schleicher to at least share power with the council until further political matters are settled. Though this will curb Schleicher’s more power hungry ambitions, it could serve as an opportunity for him to shore up support..."
rhein.republic.4.a: "Still, Schleicher has always stood for the republic, right?"
 
rhein.republic.5.t: "The Old Chancellor"
rhein.republic.5.d: "The rise of the republican forces has not gone unnoticed in the Rhine, with many speaking of a potential republican comeback that would be so shocking and awe-inspiring even the revolution of 1919 would be put to shame. Of course, such an exaggerated suggestion puts the oft-divided and in many cases weak republicans in a very good light, most especially when it comes to the presumption of republican democracy.\n\nFollowing his inglorious ousting in 1932, Kurt von Schleicher fled along with his civilian and military allies to the Rhine where he and many others now stay. Schleicher mocked by valkist propaganda as a coward and French sell-out, Schleicher is most certainly not a sell-out. A fervent nationalist and militarist, his gambit to prevent Dressler’s ascension to the presidency could hardly be described as democratic with many republicans privately scoffing at Schleicher’s autocratic desires. Nevertheless, his widespread connections to the Reichswehr has made him a crucial part of the \"Weimarer\" camp and his ambitions have most certainly not waned.\n\nEven then, maybe Schleicher has seen the error of his ways? Many republicans believe that he can be trusted and that as the constitutional chancellor who was unjustly overthrown by the valkist mob, he has every right to be the chancellor should the republicans take and hold on to power. After all, surely he would not be so greedy as to attempt another dictatorship?"
rhein.republic.5.a: "Maybe he has changed?"

rhein.republic.6.t: "The Republican Revival"
rhein.republic.6.d: "When the republic fell in 1932, many had thought that German democracy was simply a laughable dream of a bunch of weak but well-meaning men. These pessimists or valkist-sympathizers thought us totally incapable of being able to fight back and resist the Valkist bastards.\n\nWhere are the naysayers and cynics now? With our victory at the national conference we have not only revitalized, but even emboldened the new republican movement. For if we could overcome the iron grip of the French, we will be able to muster that will into the defeat of valkism, the victory of democracy and the liberation of the German people from Berlin’s thuggish regime.\n\nThis is easier said than done. And so it was decided that the republican parties would come together in this new sacred union, not unlike the one made in Paris during the Great War. With Germany in the hands of dark forces, the responsibility is now on us to fix this mistake of Europe and build a new Germany for the better."
rhein.republic.6.a: "Vorwärts!"

rhein.republic.7.t: "Prussian Fury"
rhein.republic.7.d: "Today, former Reichswehr officers led by Franz von Roques and Curt Liebmann have arrived to Koblenz without notice, demanding to know why we have decided to work with the social democrats who as of now remain outside of the coalition. Even though they seemed to have been satisfied with the reason for republican unity, it is worrying that they have even come to ask why such a thing has been done. Are they not loyal to the republic and to Germany?"
rhein.republic.7.a: "They could have remained with their masters at Zossen..."

rhein.republic.8.t: "The Republic’s Undying Foe"
rhein.republic.8.d: "It seems that despite our initial attempts, the former Reichswehr have once more desired to come to blows with the republican government. Seemingly egged on by Schleicher and other ultra-conservative elements within the coalition, the military has protested vehemently against our collaboration with the social democrats, claiming that the SPD have somehow betrayed Germany or are crypto-bolsheviks who will attempt to subjugate us to Moscow.\n\nDespite the rather ridiculous nature of these claims, it has certainly revealed the true colours of the Reichswehr, that being red-white-black. As such, we must decide whether we should attempt to compromise with them or if we should simply wait for them to give up - surely they would not attempt to do something profoundly stupid?"
rhein.republic.8.a: "We can wait them out."
rhein.republic.8.b: "Let’s throw them a bone."
rhein.republic.8.c: "Maybe the SPD are not the most suitable partners..."

rhein.republic.9.t: "A Hollow Threat?"
rhein.republic.9.d: "Rather unfortunately, it seems that the Reichswehr officers who oppose our new stance towards fellow democratic parties could not handle the mere thought of working with the social democrats. Declaring us incapable of running the republic due to our desire to work with the social democrats, they have threatened to resign unless we withdraw any attempts to work with the SPD.\n\nSuch a threat has naturally brought many in the council up in arms, most especially because of their hinting at the preferability of a national liberal cabinet run by the DVP who have seemingly promised to work with Schleicher and other Reichswehr elements to \"restore\" the republic. Although some have suggested for us to simply let them resign, others have retorted that we cannot allow these experienced officers to simply leave us and that it would risk the entire republican cause to do so. Thankfully, some Reichswehr officers have shown a willingness to help us negotiate a compromise with the officers, something that would perhaps be our best shot at preventing any further crisis."
rhein.republic.9.d.feds: "Rather unfortunately, it seems that the Reichswehr officers who oppose our new stance towards fellow democratic parties could not handle the mere thought of working with the social democrats. Declaring us incapable of running the republic due to our desire to work with the social democrats, they have threatened to resign unless we withdraw any attempts to work with the SPD.\n\nDorten has seized this opportunity, declaring that the Reichswehr are correct in their assessment and thus that their threat is a sign that cooperation with the social democrats is utterly inconceivable. This ironic turn of events has pressured the government into an unfortunate position, for conceding to the Reichswehr would be an undeniable show of weakness. On the other hand, it's highly unlikely that the military will act against us at least for the moment.\n\nThere is also however another road, for some Reichswehr officers have displayed a willingness to compromise in return for a favour to the military. With war on the horizon, surely that is acceptable?"
rhein.republic.9.a: "We can’t risk the republic’s safety."
rhein.republic.9.b: "Call in favours."
rhein.republic.9.c: "They are free to resign!"

rhein.republic.10.t: "The Officers Calm Down"
rhein.republic.10.d: "It seems that due to our past policies, the Reichswehr officers have stopped fussing over our coalition with the social democrats. Although their true alleigances are still in doubt, we can breathe easy knowing that at least for now, the republic’s security has not been compromised."
rhein.republic.10.a: "Excellent!"
  
rhein.republic.11.t: "Concessions to the Officers"
rhein.republic.11.d: "Although the image of the Prussian officer may be one of a soldier who is easily able to work with his fellow soldiers, this has not demonstrated itself totally in the current crisis. Many officers desire different things and it is so to our advantage. We can promise many things, but the most alluring to many would be the barring of any social democrat ministers. Although this would not be received well by the social democrats once they join, it would at least initially grant us plenty of gain for little cost. Another alternative would be to offer them a tougher, more united government that would be willing to spend more on their ventures. Of course, we could simply just let them complain, though this is unlikely to solve the crisis in any way."
rhein.republic.11.a: "They can be assured there will be no socialist ministers."
rhein.republic.11.b: "Bribing them will prove most valuable."

rhein.republic.12.t: "The Council’s Fate"
rhein.republic.12.d: "Our concession to the Reichswehr exiles has already threatened the stability of the first cabinet in the revived republic. Complaining about unwillingness to enforce civilian control on the provisional Reichswehr, the left-liberals and progressive centrists in the council have threatened to split as Wirth finds his position in the council ever more in peril. No matter the reason for their concession, many have lost confidence in the current Zentrum-led council to continue running the provisional republic.\n\nOut of this, some far-right politicians and especially Schleicher have suggested Eduard Dingeldey to take the reigns as head of the council. A national liberal with few qualms towards Schleicher’s authoritarian ambitions, Dingeldey has indicated his willingness to take Wirth’s place at the head of the council - along with the ensuing right-wing takeover of the council."
rhein.republic.12.a: "We can continue without crypto-bolsheviks."
rhein.republic.12.b: "Maybe something more preferable is warranted..."

rhein.republic.13.t: "Placing the Social Democrats"
rhein.republic.13.d: "With the social democrats in the coalition, the time has now come to decide how we shall proceed with them in government. As one of the largest parties in the coalition, the social democrats have demanded that they be granted important posts, relative to their popularity and influence.\n\nA key member of the social democrats in exile, Rudolf Hilferding has been floated as becoming the new Reichswirtschaftsminister. However, this has been met with immediate opposition from the liberals in the coalition, especially those concentrated around Otto Hugo in the DVP who detest the socialist Hilferding.\n\nOthers have floated granting Paul Gerlach, a long-time social democrat in the mandate who proved staunchly opposed to Valkism and as a popular local social democrat in the Rhineland. Even though this would ultimately relegate the social democrats to a secondary position in the fight against democracy, some emphasize the credit that we are granting them for even considering them for a position in the government."
rhein.republic.13.a: "Appease them with the economy."
rhein.republic.13.b: "They’re better off defending democracy."
rhein.republic.13.c: "They have no place in government."

rhein.republic.18.d: "Rather unfortunately, it seems that Koblenz has refused the notion of joining our alliance at any cost. Even though some nationalists have accepted this and have called for preparing ourselves for a Germany with the Rhine, many in Quai d'Orsay are fearful of the prospect of a greatly empowered Germany - a Germany that desires total revenge upon France.\n\nAs such, some have called for us to let the Rhenish in anyways, just in case Berlin attempts to infringe upon Rhenish sovereignty. Others have countered however that the Rhenish are simply too untrustworthy anyways, especially with their status as a rival government."

We bled for the Entente in the Great War to stop the Kaiser’s imperialistic ambitions, and we were rightfully owed the Rhineland. Crafty as ever, Washington and London had other plans, seeking to prevent us from what they mistakenly saw as Napoleonic ambitions.\n\nOur worst fears have now come to be. With the Rhenish making a grave mistake in going with the failures from the dead republic, they have opted to instead join the [RHI.GetFactionName] in a disastrous bid for self-protection. Worst of all, this has severely compromised our plans for a second war with Germany. Now that they stand alone between us and the Reich, the Rhenish state is most certainly doomed, and the Germans will do all that they can to place the fighting within the area where the wretched Koblenz government now lies. Either way, this has been a disaster for our strategic prospects."

The remnants of the failed Free Worker’s Union of Germany, the FAUR has lived a rather miserable existence in the now-former mandate. With their limited popularity amongst the workers in the industrial basin of the Rhineland, the FAUR has struggled to get off the ground and for many seemed like just another socialist movement to crush.\n\nWith the effort towards the loyalty of the trade unions however, many have feared that this will result in a massive increase in FAUR influence as the primary trade union opposed to cooperation with the government. As such, many are prepared to crush this pest once and for all."

However, many are afraid of granting anyone the power of the Reichspräsident at this point in time - lest we experience another Schleicher."

Now, the council has to decide whether or not to restore the old presidency at this current juncture.\n\nSome say that such a move would prove instrumental to demonstrating ourselves as the legitimate government in Germany. With Marx having proven himself as a democratic bastion, many are confident that the Reichspräsident will prove to be a staunch defender of democracy. However, such a move may prove counterproductive to our desire to restore the republic and German democracy. Restoring such a powerful position now may cause further division and provide the chance for radicals to doom the republic. So what shall it be?"

Such a role is one of great power, begetting great responsibility in turn. With former president Marx having declined to take back the post of president, we must now decide who shall take the role of the next president.\n\nOne option that has been floated is the presidential runner-up Karl Jarres. Running in 1925 as the right’s choice for president, Jarres will provide much legitimacy with Jarres himself being popular amongst the Rhenish cities. However, some fear that he is simply too right wing for such a title, most especially with the radical nature of who we are opposing. Many in Zentrum have suggested Carl Spiecker, a former press chief and prolific editor and publisher. As a more progressive member of Zentrum, many feel that Speicker will prove to be a more appropriate president in the struggle against Valkism - especially with Speicker’s antivalkist track record.\n\nWith Zentrum having proposed a candidate however, the Democrats and Social Democrats could not be outdone. They have proposed candidates of their own, with the Democrats supporting Hartmann von Richthofen, a former banker and a well-connected and staunch liberal republican. The Social Democrats meanwhile back Wilhelm Sollmann, a social democrat with a long history in the now-former mandate. With so many figures ready to step up to the challenge, now it only remains to see who shall take this key role."

rhein.republic.31.t: "Consolidating our Hold"
rhein.republic.31.d: "When we moved to restore the position of president in the government, many had wondered what the infamously ambitious Schleicher would do with such a powerful position. Historically limiting his savvy dealings to political backrooms, it was to be expected that Schleicher himself would not desire to take the presidency.\n\nIn fact, Schleicher so far has been unable to forward anyone as president that would both relieve the many democrats and also work and cooperate with Schleicher’s group. Such a reality is mainly due to the Republican Council, having opted to remain as a check on Schleicher’s well-known ambitions. Stymying his consolidation of power at every turn, there is little doubt that the republican council have impeded the work towards restoring the republic and as such must be dealt with.\n\nBut how? Some suggest that as chancellor and as the Reichswehr’s chosen chancellor, Schleicher can simply force out the current council head, the progressive Joseph Wirth and make himself head of the republican council. This would certainly grant Schleicher powers beyond measure, but it would quickly rile up the democrats who would see this as the obvious power grab that it is.\n\nSo maybe an unknown would be good? An East Prussian notable, Horst von Restorff fled to the former mandate in 1933 to escape the revolutionary wrath that Dressler unleashed upon all of Germany. Having remained in obscurity, his former connections with the Nationalists and seeming normalcy have made him the perfect candidate in Schleicher’s eyes to temporarily take charge of the council. After Schleicher has consolidated his rule, he will then do away with this democratic mistake and secure himself from democratic intransigence once and for all."

With his gambit now over, Schleicher’s continued tenure seems untenable..."
rhein.republic.32.d: "Chancellor Schleicher has not had a good run as of recent. Facing continuous political defeats, the initial enthusiasm for the old chancellor has seemingly vanished with only a scant few conservatives remaining to back the general. His inability to work his supposed political magic has lost him much favour amongst the Reichswehr officers he supposedly represents, with their view that he was merely a politician and not a real soldier. Brought in with the expectation that he would change the fortunes of the republic, Schleicher’s inability to do so has alienated him from many Germans, who now see him as another failed politician."

rhein.republic.33.d: "With the Enabling Act passed and the republican council now totally incapable of stopping Schleicher, Schleicher’s next step is now clear. With the remaining democratic opposition more afraid of [GER.GetLeader] than of Schleicher, Schleicher now finds himself without any opposition to his clique’s total control.\n\nNevertheless, Schleicher still has more decisions to make. Although his opposition is few, Schleicher has little popular support, whether amongst the Rhinelanders or even the Germans at large. Should Schleicher attempt to totally consolidate his control, he will find himself in a crisis of legitimacy - one that would be disastrous for any ambitions of reclaiming Berlin. However, adhering to some form of civilian government would be a temporary arrangement at best for Schleicher who truly desires to entrench the Reichswehr into the defence of Germany."

Even though the political parties have yet to totally withdraw support, we must be ready to tread lightly - lest Schleicher find himself out of the chancellorship again."

In spite of all his continuous machinations and attempts to consolidate power, Schleicher has proven incapable of dislodging the republican institutions that protected German democracy for many years as the struggling nation bounced from crisis to crisis.\n\nWith this failure, Schleicher has now proven himself as yet another relic of the reactionary past that hangs onto the rightful German government. Even when faced with a mighty opponent from within, the republic survived and came out on top. Tendering his resignation to the rump Reichstag, Schleicher has now sunk back into an inglorious destiny - all whilst the republic’s destiny grows ever and ever brighter."

Facing massive levels of unpopularity for his rather mediocre performance, Schleicher’s opposition now only grows and grows. Many even believe that Schleicher will soon withdraw and never return to the halls of power.\n\nNow Schleicher faces a choice.

rhein.republic.54.d: "In a rather peculiar turn of events, the DVP has once again found itself at the head of government. However, Dingeldey is no Stresemann with his rise and running of the DVP having resulted in its continuous struggle to even maintain its existence. At the core of the split in the party is the question: who does the DVP represent?\n\nWith the DVP dissolving itself and its members fleeing to the mandate, the return of the DVP following the revival of the republic has once again sparked a conflict in the party. The Young Liberals, a group of relatively younger liberals have since the crises of the early 1920 called for the DVP to truly become a people’s party, one with widespread appeal not just amongst the traditional capitalists that support the party, but one that unites the bourgeois class just like how Zentrum unites Catholics. Led by Frank Glatzel, the Young Liberals have also found much support among white-collar unions, though their ties to the valkist-adjacent Young Conservative movement has not done well to reconcile them with the party.\n\nHowever, the other side of the party does not prove itself to be much more liberal. Sternly in favour of the interests of heavy industry, the right-wing of the party, with many spokesmen amongst them being Otto Hugo and Adolf Heuck have strongly opposed any attempt to move to liberal unity. Worse of all, many in their ranks prefer an alignment with the reactionaries in the Rhineland, desiring to merge the DVP into a staunch party of the right.\n\nDingeldey now finds himself in a conundrum. Having been placed into power for his seeming willingness to further liberal unity, it has proven far more difficult to resist the advance of the party’s main backers - especially in these extraordinary times."
rhein.republic.54.a: "We must forge the party of the middle."
rhein.republic.54.b: "We shall not forget our backers."

rhein.republic.55.t: "An Amenable Council?"
rhein.republic.55.d: "With the question of the presidency looming over the republican government, Schleicher now faces a rather odd roadblock. Even though DVP members staff many of the roles in the council, the republican council, led by Eduard Dingeldey still remains quite obstinate to Schleicher’s advances. Although sympathetic to some of the general’s positions, the esoteric nature of Schleicher’s alliance with the unions and certain social democrats has caused the business backers of the DVP to heavily doubt Schleicher’s suitability as the national leader.\n\nHowever, the council has not decided to remain silent. Either feeling their own power weakening or Schleicher’s power growing, the DVP has reached out to Schleicher to aid him in his continued consolidation of power. In their view, Schleicher can remain as chancellor and do away with the republican council once the national situation determines it so. In return, an alliance between Schleicher and the DVP will be made with Schleicher allowed to do whatever is necessary until Germany is reunited.\n\nThis alliance would certainly greatly ease Schleicher’s takeover. That said, it would fundamentally sully what Schleicher has gained in working-class support and may even cause him to be subject to the whims of the young liberals and their big business rivals. Such a state would simply be mere folly, and besides; Germany at her greatest time of crisis does not need further politicking between two parties."
rhein.republic.55.a: "None of this is necessary - Schleicher needs both roles."
rhein.republic.55.b: "Let's hear them out."

rhein.republic.56.t: "The National-Minded Act"
rhein.republic.56.d: "With Schleicher ever firmer in his control, the time has come for the liberals to hold up their end of the deal. With the aid of the DVP, Schleicher, long feared for his autocratic ambitions, has finally readied his coup de grâce for German democracy.\n\nCiting the existential threat of Berlin and the failures of the democratic system,  Schleicher has prepared an act that will ensure that the chancellor will be granted all prerogatives to act in the interests of the German state and that the parliamentary and judicial institutions will be reduced, \"temporarily/", to what would essentially be advisory roles. Confident in his chances, the time has come for Schleicher to finish what he has started."
rhein.republic.56.a: "We shall defend the national interest!"

rhein.republic.57.t: "Victory for the Young Liberals"
rhein.republic.57.d: "In the face of all opposition, the Enabling Law has passed. However, it has not passed as far as Schleicher would have liked. Far from the original all-powerful chancellor without question, Schleicher now finds himself forced to restate the importance of personal freedoms. Worse of all, the liberal handling of the act has resulted in Schleicher facing pressure for concessions on his end to the industrialists and white-collar unions who back the DVP, forcing him into a bind between cooperating with the unions and fulfilling these concessions.\n\nOf course it is not all bad. Schleicher still reigns with nearly unchecked powers, few will be able to stop him should he need to force something through. Yet, Schleicher will have to wait for longer to attain full power, which owing to his poor health may not be something he has much more off..."
rhein.republic.57.a: "So be it."

rhein.republic.58.t: "The Agricultural Crisis"
rhein.republic.58.d: "With Germany finally liberated from the Valkist scourge, the question of agriculture once again has creeped into the forefront. Whilst the Valkists promised to revitalize agriculture, the reality is that German farmers still remain incapable of competing with cheap foreign foodstuffs without aid from the government in the form of protectionism.\n\nThis has naturally ruffled the liberal feathers within our government as well as many industrialists, who desire more well-fed workers for their factories and the total industrialization of Germany. On the other hand, many rural elements deeply oppose such measures and threaten to support opposing conservative parties that will certainly not put into effect any liberalisation of the agriculture market. The government must hence now decide - what shall it do?"
rhein.republic.58.a: "Times have changed..."
rhein.republic.58.b: "We must defend our local farmers!"
rhein.republic.58.c: "Perhaps we can find a compromise?"

rhein.republic.59.t: "The People's Conservative Union"
rhein.republic.59.d: "Following his return to power, Schleicher and his allies have not wasted any time in ensuring that all of his potential allies are able to come together and support the chancellor in his endeavors. To this end, politicians hailing from all sorts of parties and affiliations have banded together to form the \"Volkskonservative Union\", an organization that overcomes the silly and petty nature of partisan parties with a broad front of support by all the German people. Even if some doubt the democratic nature of this front, it would be difficult to find anything wrong with it - especially with Berlin at the gates."
rhein.republic.59.a: "Let us reforge the system!"

rhein.republic.60.t: "In Defence of the Reich"
rhein.republic.60.d: "Despite the hopes of many democrats, the reality is that the ‘Red General’ and chancellor Kurt von Schleicher was anything but a responsible democratic leader. Consolidating his hold in the executive and centralizing control for the government, Schleicher now stands unopposed with few in Koblenz even able to consider rebellion against the new government.\n\nThe next step was thus to do away with the image of a democratic coalition of parties. The antiquated People’s Conservative Union was to be replaced by a true government standing for and with the German people. The new German Fatherland Front shall from now on protect Germany from the dangers of unbridled radicalism and ineffective liberalism."
rhein.republic.60.a: "To a new Germany!"

rhein.republic.61.t: "Into The Wehrstaat"
rhein.republic.61.d: "We have come out victorious, but all is not well with Schleicher. Suffering from pernicious anemia ever since his rise to power, Schleicher’s health forced him into the backseat as we rebuilt Germany. Out of this vacuum, the future of Schleicher’s government seemed uncertain. Would it turn into a phony democracy between generally agreeable parties? Would the barons of old make a grand political comeback?\n\nThese predictions are now however in hindsight laughably untrue. Schleicher was always a man of the army - now with a reinforced belief in the necessity of Germany’s readiness for the next war. If there have been two consecutive calamitous wars in Europe, what is preventing the third? If - no - when the next war breaks out, Germany must come out on top over all powers.\n\nAnd so it shall be, the greatest protector of the German people in her history - the army shall ensure Germany does not come out short."

Out of this vacuum, the future of Schleicher’s government seemed uncertain. Would it turn into a phony democracy between generally agreeable parties? Would the barons of old make a grand political comeback?\n\nThe republican system has always proved rather admirable in some respects for Germany. In spite of the attempts of Marxists and right-wing radicals to overthrow the system by force, they failed in the face of republican resilience. Even the scheming Dressler could only take power through the popular will of the German people, unfortunate as that may be. With the lessons of 1932 in mind, this time we shall ensure that Germany is not rocked by terrorists of all stripes and colours.\n\nThis time, Germany will find herself in the ascendant position she has always deserved."

Out of this vacuum, the future of Schleicher’s government seemed uncertain. Would it turn into a phony democracy between generally agreeable parties? Would the barons of old make a grand political comeback?\n\nThe old republic was always the product of proletarian rabble and despicable Marxists. In their at best misguided and at worst malicious attempt to change the old system, they overturned everything that made Germany great. Although the monarchy admittedly left much to be desired, the republic that replaced it was a simple partisan exercise in Bolshevism.\n\nThankfully, this shall no longer be the case. Through the efforts of the elite, Germany is now back in the hands of the most capable men - ready to reclaim her spot in the world."

rhein.republic.64.d: "Years have passed since the German people were able to make themselves heard at the polls. While an entirely liberal democratic system is not desirable, elections are key to ensuring that the people are content and heard. To ensure the integrity of the elections, we have taken the liberty to ensure only the most reliable of parties can easily participate.\n\nNow, it is a competition between the Conservative People’s Party, supported mainly by the rural countryside as well as social conservatives and the German People’s Party, a reinvigorated party of the middle class that will ensure German prosperity for years to come."

rhein.republic.66.t: "A New Executive"
rhein.republic.66.d: "As we endeavor to build a new Germany, the question of who shall take the lead has arisen. While Goerdeler has served us well, some would prefer that he take a back seat as other forces come into the fray. One such force are the Catholic conservatives, previously party to Zentrum until the end of the monarchy. Whilst Valkist rule has hit them hard, they have still made their voices heard with their desire for the the baron Hermann von Lüninck to take the position as Reichspräsident until the time is right for a restoration of the monarchy.\n\nOn the other hand, some feel that these aristocratic voices are ill-suited for a new Germany. The association of Hermann with his Young Conservative brother Ferdinand von Lüninck has also not been taken well by some, who feel that Herbert von Bose ought to take the role as Reichspräsident, potentially even permanently."
rhein.republic.66.a: "Herr Lüninck will please the aristocrats."
rhein.republic.66.b: "Bose will see to Germany's resurrection."

rhein.republic.67.t: "A Chief of State?"
rhein.republic.67.d: "With the old civilian government now entirely enmeshed within the military apparatus, we must now decide who will boldly lead Germany into the future. Some have floated that press chief Erich Marcks would be adept at such a role, with his experience in dealing with the public potentially proving useful.\n\nOn the other hand, Schleicher’s right hand man has always been Ferdinand von Bredow. While Bredow has always been a man of the shadows, there is little need to hide behind a curtain anymore in the new Reich. Additionally, some military officers have cautioned against overt military intrusion - the Reichspräsident ought to remain a position held by experienced politicians."
rhein.republic.67.a: "Erich Marcks will provide public appeal."

# Federals!

rhein.federals.0.t: "The Federal Project"
rhein.federals.0.d: "As we march forward towards the true freedom of Germany, we must be ready to unravel the many ways that Prussian domination has suffocated the rest of Germany since unification. From the army to the bureaucracy, far too many Prussian agents or even outright Prussians attempt to stop us from bringing about a federal Germany where all states band together to protect our freedoms. In one grand sweep, Germany will be liberated from Prussia forever.\n\nThe reality however is a little bit less severe. Even if many believe that Prussia will merely have to be stricken from the record for Germany’s malaise to disappear, few expect that there will be little resistance to such a move. At all levels of society, we must be ready to not only suppress Prussian discontent, but we must prove that federalism is the way forward for Germany."
rhein.federals.0.a: "This may cause trouble..."

rhein.federals.1.t: "An Unlikely Alliance"
rhein.federals.1.d: "Finding themselves beat at the national conference, the separatist camp splintered, with their last chance at power seemingly totally ruined by the outcome of the conference. From this rubble, both separatists have come out as irreconcilable foes with Dorten denouncing his former ally as a socialist, Prussian agent and Matthes decrying Dorten’s apparent ineptitude and blaming him for the movement’s recent ills.\n\nOut of this chaos, Adenauer would now find himself as the only Rhinelander capable of stopping the \"Weimarers\" from asserting Prussian dominance over the new Rhenish state. With the republican movement seeming unstoppable, it appeared that the only true way to mediate the damage done by a republican bloc would be to force the true wishes of the Rhinelander upon them.\n\nAnd so it was. Together with Adenauer, Dorten has brought his allies together to form a united federalist party in cooperation with Zentrum, an alliance that has come as a total surprise to both domestic and international observers. Even if the republic is to endure, there is little expectation that this new one will share much in common with its previous incarnation."
rhein.federals.1.a: "Two separatists...for the republic?"

rhein.federals.2.t: "Reconciling the Centre"
rhein.federals.2.d: "As we embark on our federal project, the next question we must ask ourselves is as to who shall take the reins of state. Both Adenauer and Dorten lead rather different blocs even if their policies are not all-too dissimilar. To complicate matters, many are unsure as to how powerful the presidency shall be in a new federal republic. With the power of the president vague and the competing factions seemingly unwilling to settle on a compromise candidate, a choice will have to be made."
rhein.federals.2.a: "Adenauer has the credibility necessary."
rhein.federals.2.b: "Dorten will appease the separatists."

rhein.federals.3.t: "The Reichswehr Question"
rhein.federals.3.d: "Disappointingly, it seems that the Reichswehr - infested with Prussian officers has not taken our new course of action very kindly. Although they are right that the social democrats may not be the most desirable partners, they have made it a point to openly rebuke us for attempting to work democratically and in the interests of the republic.\n\nBe that as it may, many republicans can see that they have yet to openly support someone who seeks to uproot the current federalist project. As such, some have suggested that we concede some ground to this Prussian haven, or at the very least promise to improve where the republic failed."
rhein.federals.3.a: "They will see that we grant responsible government."
rhein.federals.3.b: "Just leave them be - we will deal with them once Berlin is defeated."
rhein.federals.3.c: "They have no grounds for anything!"

rhein.federals.4.t: "The Prussian Bulwark"
rhein.federals.4.d: "As expected, the Prussian officers seemingly could not take any more of our goals. Citing their irreconcilability with the current government, a good chunk of the Reichswehr officers have opted to officially retire. Whilst this will no doubt prove a tremendous blow to our military potential, many counter that we will now be more able to pursue military reform and that it will have been for the better in the long run."
rhein.federals.4.a: "The Prussians got rid of themselves..."

rhein.federals.5.t: "Severing Speaks Out"
rhein.federals.5.d: "Even as we continue to work towards Germany’s freedom, it still seems some old republican figures cannot help but blather their unfair critique of our ways. Due to recent events, Carl Severing, the former Social Democrat interior minister for Prussia has spoken out against us. Painting us as a loose band of Rhenish separatists, he has claimed that we will simply allow Germany to be split up into several states.\n\nEven if he has not been met with rebuke, his criticism signals continued discontentment amongst the \"Weimarers\" in the government and public. With the presence felt everywhere, many feel that their cooperation may not continue for much longer if we continue down this path."
rhein.federals.5.a: "Why on EARTH should we listen to him?"

rhein.federals.6.t: "Radical Opposition"
rhein.federals.6.d: "As we continue down our path towards Germany's freedom, it seems that some extremists still cannot help themselves from terrorizing innocent civilians. Over the last few weeks, an uptick in extremist terror has struck the Rhineland. Whether they proclaim us as dividers of the workers or national traitors, the actions of these Bolsheviks and Valkists have hindered our efforts at turning Germany into a truly federal and free nation."
rhein.federals.6.a: "Proof that Prussianism leads to destruction."

rhein.federals.7.t: "The Palatinate Problem"
rhein.federals.7.d: "As refugees continue to flee from Prussian tyranny, it seems that a rather peculiar problem has come out - the issue of the Palatinate.\n\nEver since our rise to power, the Palatinate separatists have occupied a position in our government that has lent them much power compared to when they were mere collaborators of the French. To this end, they have continued to agitate from their positions of power for the promise of a free Palatinate, away from Bavarian rule and towards a free state of their own or at least an autonomous state within a free Rhineland. Led by Franz Josef Heinz, this group would have seemed to remain relatively minor as compared to the massive organizations led by the DFP and Zentrum.\n\nWith the flight of many Bavarian politicians however, many of these refugees have urged us to ignore the Palatinate separatists or even to outright rebuke them. Even if they have little influence comparatively, these politicians may prove crucial to regaining support in Bavaria once we have overthrown Berlin. Still, would it not be disgraceful to betray our old allies?"
rhein.federals.7.a: "We need to think big."
rhein.federals.7.b: "Dressler rose from Bavaria - why would we let those bastards decide anything?"

rhein.federals.8.t: "Separatist Blues"
rhein.federals.8.d: "In an unfortunate but expected turn of events, the Palatinate separatists have not taken the news of their marginalisation well. Commenting on our hostility towards their separatism, the Palatinate members of our cabinet have threatened to resign and leave outright - threatening the stability of our cabinet.\n\nEven so, this may not have been a huge blow. That would be until fellow Rhenish separatists began to rally behind the Palatinate separatists. United in their opposition towards what they perceive as us favouring the old order and old structure of the republic, these separatists as a bloc have begun to viciously lobby against us and pose a true risk to stability remaining in the DFP. As such, many have called for us to reverse our stance and favour the separatists over the Bavarians - after all, what use do they have for us now?"
rhein.federals.8.a: "Maybe these exiles are not so important..."
rhein.federals.8.b: "We cannot reverse course now."

rhein.federals.9.t: "Bavarian Fury"
rhein.federals.9.d: "Our recent actions towards the autonomy of the Palatinate have not been received terribly positively amongst the Bavarian exiles. In some truly polemical articles, Bavarian journalists have compared us to Prussia and stated that Adenauer and Dorten’s true aim is to simply turn the Rhineland into a new Prussia. Although such an accusation is so heinous that it ought to be laughed out, some have suggested that we instead reach for peace with the Bavarians and compromise with them so as to maintain stability in the government."
rhein.federals.9.a: "Let's throw them a bone."
rhein.federals.9.b: "They have no right to tell us how to run a country."

rhein.federals.10.t: "The Separatist Departure"
rhein.federals.10.d: "In a bold move, the separatists in-government have made good on their promise. Refusing to cooperate any further with a government that they feel is hostile towards their autonomy, the Palatinate separatists along with their Rhenish friends have left the government.\n\nSuch a move has proved a near-fatal blow to Dorten’s power within the federalist movement. With much of his base having either left or grown disillusioned from the infighting, his fall from grace may very well come sooner than he would like."
rhein.federals.10.a: "Curse them!"

rhein.federals.11.t: "Satisfied Bavarians"
rhein.federals.11.d: "In spite of their initial outrage at our willingness to concede to the Palatinate separatists, the Bavarian exiles have seemingly begun to pipe down their discontent with the government. With Berlin being the primary threat to Germany’s freedom as of now, the many exiles from the Reich have opted to close ranks with the separatists - prepared to fight against the imposition of tyranny and despair upon the free Germans."
rhein.federals.11.a: "Not a usual sight..."

rhein.federals.12.t: "The Federal Question"
rhein.federals.12.d: "Although most predicted that we would at some point proclaim our intent to lead a more federal and free Germany, this has yet to be made certain. Many republicans still hold out hope that the federal state can be delayed until Germany has been liberated from her valkist overlords.\n\nIn turn, the newly-minted federalist camp has fought for our goal for a new federal republic to be our main goal. Of course, some proposals for the federation to come have proved nothing more than nicely worded proposals for a confederation of German states that would see Germany more divided than ever in its history. Nevertheless, the political demand for some form of action to determine the state’s future has grown to an all-time high, and now we must decide if we are to proceed with the creation of the new federal Germany."
rhein.federals.12.a: "Onwards!"
rhein.federals.12.b: "Let's not be too hasty."

rhein.federals.13.t: "The \"Weimarers\" Strike Back"
rhein.federals.13.d: "Following the inaugural speech of [RHI.GetLeaderName], the debate on the future of free Germany was to begin. Unfortunately, the first minutes would soon be filled with not the hope and vision of the federal vision, but the bitterness and venom of the old republicans. Pointing to Dressler’s near uncontested hold in Bavaria as an example of federalism run mad and that the Valkist movement allying with those who would favour a more federal solution, the \"Weimarers\" have made continuing the conference a difficult affair to say the least.\n\nWe can thus tread upon two paths. Their obstructionism and plain unwillingness to work within the system has not endeared these fossils of 1920 to the general public. On the other hand, many point out that expelling these republicans would sully the legitimacy of not only the federalist movement, but also the republican mantle that we claim to uphold."
rhein.federals.13.a: "They can get lost."
rhein.federals.13.b: "Hear them out."

rhein.federals.14.t: "Vertrag oder Diktat?"
rhein.federals.14.d: "As the days have worn on, another painful matter has risen to the forefront of discussion. The hated treaty of Versailles, the dictate of the West upon Germany is a topic that few Germans would like to discuss and even fewer would ever accept. Officially ripping away the Rhineland for its German homeland amongst other baffling and cruel stipulations, there was little doubt that the treaty had to at least be re-negotiated, if not overturned entirely.\n\nBut that was the past. In the present, Berlin has outright rejected the treaty whilst we are now left with the choice of taking up the commitments that the treaty theoretically binds Germany with. Considering that London and Paris are more interested in the defeat of Berlin than in restraining us, few are worried about the outcome of the renegotiation. On the other hand, accepting the treaty in entirety would not endear us to any self-respecting German and may even signal the permanent loss of global respect and prestige."
rhein.federals.14.a: "We must accept reality."
rhein.federals.14.b: "No comment."

rhein.federals.15.t: "Reviving the Federal Structure"
rhein.federals.15.d: "As the conference rolls on, more questions about how exactly the new state will operate have begun to emerge. How powerful will the new central government be? Can states opt for any government they wish? What shall the capital of this new republic be? Will the new federal state even be a federal republic?\n\nMany separatists, especially those allied with Hans Adam Dorten vastly prefer to revive some form of German confederation. The unification of Germany by Prussia was a mistake and not merely in the sense of Prussian oppression, but the forced binding of states closer together than they would have ever naturally come. For his part, Adenauer has seemingly remained in the middle, clearly unwilling to anger the now utterly enraged members of Zentrum in favour of the hostile Dorten.\n\nWith many republicans declaring the calls by the separatists as treason and refusing to concede any ground to them, now it is up to us to break the deadlock. This of course is easier said than done, but surely it would not be too difficult to postpone such an important question until later?"
rhein.federals.15.a: "...will necessitate an equal confederation of states."
rhein.federals.15.b: "...will require a union of free states."
rhein.federals.15.c: "...will be a matter of another time."

rhein.federals.16.t: "The Last Words"
rhein.federals.16.d: "As the conference begins to wind down, many in the conference are feeling hope and optimism that has never before been witnessed since the revolution of 1920. Now however, what we say last before closing has become a hot issue in the backrooms of government. Some opine that we should emphasize the importance of reunification, though this would give the impression that a federal state would be the means to an end that is free Germany. On the other hand, federalists have urged us to stick to the federalist message - would not a Prussian democracy in the end be as awful as a German tyranny?"
rhein.federals.16.a: "A united Germany is most important!"
rhein.federals.16.b: "What is the good in unity without freedom?"

rhein.federals.17.t: "Industrial Skepticism"
rhein.federals.17.d: "It seems that despite our best efforts to sooth over our integration of the social democrats into the coalition, some of our industrial backers have raised serious concerns. Most relevant of all, Albert Vögler, a key steel and coal magnate, has rallied a key group of industrialists in protesting the entry of the SPD into our coalition. Whilst this is obviously their right to do so, it still raises questions as to their true intent..."
rhein.federals.17.a: "Seriously?"

rhein.federals.18.t: "The Capitalist Revolt"
rhein.federals.18.d: "In a move that was to be expected but still shocking all the same, the industrial wing of the DFP has now threatened to secede from the party. Supported by major magnates like Albert Vögler and Paul Silverberg, these corporate puppets have demanded that we break off from allying with the social democrats entirely, otherwise they will leave along with all the financial and material support granted to the DFP by heavy industry.\n\nThis now puts us in a difficult position. With the DFP as a crucial partner in the coalition, allowing them to collapse further would not be in the interest of forwarding the federalist state. On the other hand, many feel that such a threat is hollow and with little to it beyond the weight of some elites.."
rhein.federals.18.a: "They cannot determine our democracy."
rhein.federals.18.b: "We must make some painful sacrifices in the name of freedom."

rhein.federals.19.t: "Fraying Coalition"
rhein.federals.19.d: "Our decision to stall coalition negotiations with the social democrats has predictably not been taken well by them. Denouncing our capitulation to heavy industry as reactionary, the social democrats have even gone so far as to refuse any further collaboration with the democratic government so long as we continue down the current path.\n\nThis incendiary response can only be met by either further negotiation or by deciding to stand fast against the social democrats. Whilst the former course of action will no doubt prove costly and difficult, the latter may prove to be too dangerous to consider unless we can rely on the SPD’s weakness."
rhein.federals.19.a: "They are free to remain hopelessly obstructionist."
rhein.federals.19.b: "Compromise is our business."

rhein.federals.20.t: "Another Defeat for Social Democracy"
rhein.federals.20.d: "With the SPD having refused any further cooperation and our refusal to continue cooperation with them as long as they do so, it appears that we have reached an impasse with the socialists. Luckily for us, such an impasse has not proven beneficial for the social democrats. With their policy of obstructionism proving unable to stop us from governing, the social democrats have devolved back into instability with it becoming apparent that they will not return as a credible political force any time soon."
rhein.federals.20.a: "Socialism shall not infect the Rhine!"

rhein.federals.21.t: "A Failure of Democracy"
rhein.federals.21.d: "It seems that we have gambled wrongly when it came to refusing further cooperation with the social democrats. Successfully framing us as feeble centrists unable to rescue German democracy, the social democrats have proven able to combat us as a rival political force - meaning that they will remain as a thorn in our side for the years to come."
rhein.federals.21.a: "Damn..."

rhein.federals.22.t: "The Industrial Bargain"
rhein.federals.22.d: "It seems that the industrialists have made good on their promise, splitting the Free Democrats in yet another case of liberal splintering. As the German People’s Party reforms along the lines of being the slaves of heavy industry, we must now decide whether we will be able to somehow turn this situation in our favour.\n\nLuckily for us, the industrialists have given us the chance to do so. Threatening to withhold all financial and material support from the rightful republican government, the industrialists are seemingly prepared to see that the federal project go up in smoke. If we cooperate with the other democratic parties however, we will most certainly be able to resist them and to force the other magnates into at least compliance if not submission."
rhein.federals.22.a: "Surely he is kidding?"
rhein.federals.22.b: "Maybe there is a middle ground?"

rhein.federals.23.t: "The Strike of the Magnates"
rhein.federals.23.d: "Rather unfortunately, it seems that the industrialists have made good on their promise to withhold all material and financial support from us. With Vögler leaving the government, our economic prospects have most certainly diminished as many wonder how long it will take before we can make up for the lost economic output."
rhein.federals.23.a: "Magnates striking? How ironic..."

rhein.federals.24.t: "Vögler Resigns"
rhein.federals.24.d: "Together with the other democratic parties, we have made our stand against the machinations of heavy industry. With other magnates seemingly afraid of rocking the boat too much and turning the public against them, Vögler has found himself in an untenable situation. Announcing his resignation today, the industrialist has seemingly left government for good as democracy continues to proudly stand on the Rhine. His replacement should in turn hopefully be much more amenable to democracy and the current government."
rhein.federals.24.a: "No one will miss him..."

rhein.federals.25.t: "Compromises All Over"
rhein.federals.25.d: "It seems that the whole crisis that we found ourselves in has been defused, if only in the most mediocre way possible. With our negotiations having culminated in compromises with both the left and the right, the government can rest easy knowing that peace has been maintained - though only at the cost of our credibility and image..."

rhein.federals.26.d: "With a free Germany, the time has come for elections to be held so that all Germans may make their voices heard. Out of the rubble of the deceased Reich, several main parties have emerged - seeking to find themselves at the head of government.\n\nThe traditional party for moderate conservatives and Catholics, Zentrum has been reinvigorated by the recent war, though this has come with the Centre facing the most divisions since the beginning of the old republic. With the party undecided whether it shall continue to uphold the Catholic mantle or to turn itself into a cross-denominational conservative party, many predict the elections will decide as to the party’s ultimate fate.\n\n[RHI_spd_election_desc]\n\n[RHI_lib_election_desc]"
RHI_spd_election: "In spite of their crippling failures during the past decades, the Social Democrats have successfully bounced back. Traditionally the party for the working class, many hope that the reinvigorated democratic spirit and a newfound socialist spirit will lead to the SPD returning to the electoral dominance they once held during Weimar."
RHI_ru_election: "With a free Rhineland, the new party for the German proletariat has unveiled itself. Led by the bombastic Josef Friedrich Matthes, the Independence League has rebranded itself as the \"Rhenish Union\", promising a better life for the long-struggling workers of the Rhineland. Having been legitimized over the course of the recent conflict, some predict that they might even take on the mantle of social democracy - at least in the Rhineland."
RHI_dstvp_election: "The liberal movement has faced many failures over the course of the Weimar era, but perhaps the most crippling by far was the splintering of the liberal movement. With the DVP and DDP on opposite sides of the same liberal coin, both parties attempted to fuse the bourgeois middle-class political movement together in a single political party. Whilst this might have ended in failure back in 1930, the new political atmosphere has proved conducive to the merger of the liberal parties - fulfilling the legacy Stresemann hoped to leave behind."
RHI_dpd_election: "Few could have predicted that the infamous separatist Hans Adam Dorten would ever become the predominant leader of the liberal movement, but his alliance with Adenauer would soon shift fate. With the end of the state of emergency in the Reich, Dorten has collaborated with other liberals to form a much more big-tent and federalist bourgeois party, no doubt with significant favour towards the industrialists along the great Rhine."
RHI_rhp_election: "The Independence League however is not the only separatist movement to have rebranded following the victory of the Rhenish spirit. Gathering those who are neither Catholic nor Marxist, the Rhenish People’s Association led by Hans Adam Dorten has reformed into the \"Rhenish Homeland Party\", promising to bring about a more free and prosperous Rhineland. While Dorten may not be the staunchest liberal in the former Reich, enthusiasm for the separatist cause has buoyed his movement into relevance, mixed with a fear of the supposed radicalism of Matthes."
RHI_irrelevant_libs: "The liberal camp however has not been so lucky. With both the social democrats and Centre sucking out much of the political oxygen, the liberals have not helped themselves either with a split between Dorten’s ailing movement and the old liberals of Weimar. Their contest in this election is thus in many ways moot and now the only factor they play is the outcome of the future liberal movement."

rhein.federals.27.t: "The Tower"
rhein.federals.27.d: "What is the future of Zentrum? Ever since the arrival of the republic, this question has haunted the old party. Created to oppose the Kulturkampf waged by Bismarck following the formation of Germany, the party has served as a bulwark of the republic. Yet, it struggles to decide what it shall become. For many within the party, keeping the party as an exclusively Catholic party can only herald a continued inability to oppose the social democrats on key issues as well as force the party to forever play third wheel in coalitions. The opening of the party into a cross-denominational Christian party with labour friendly aspects would allow it to once and for all triumph over its liberal and left-wing competitors.\n\nOn the other hand, such an opening of the party to all denominations would simply result in the end of the conservative Protestant parties that littered the old republic. This would also mean an overall shift to the right which has thus been opposed by many on the left-wing of the party who feel that the greatest opposition to Zentrum historically has been the protestant Prussian right rather than the social democrats with which they feel a greater democratic affinity for."
rhein.federals.27.a: "Zentrum has remained and shall remain!"
rhein.federals.27.b: "It is time to leave the tower."

rhein.federals.28.t: "The Divided Middle"
rhein.federals.28.d: "Even with the unity of the liberal parties, the direction of German liberalism still remains murky. One of the mistakes of 1932 that remains undeniable is the loss of popular support to the Valkists. This loss resulted in the election of Dressler and the ensuing collapse of Weimar. While social democracy and its populist imitators will always remain attractive to the working class, it does not mean that German liberalism ought also to not make an effort to provide something to them. After all, is it not true that all Germans should have equal opportunity?\n\nOf course, the right-wing of the new party begs to differ. Support from the working class was not enough for Valkism to take hold. The splintering of the middle class parties into squabbling interest groups that ultimately danced to Valkism’s deceiving tune crippled the ability of the old People’s Party to oppose the Valkist movement. German liberalism finds its supporters predominantly among the middle class, so should its focus not remain there?"
rhein.federals.28.a: "The class boundary must be crossed."
rhein.federals.28.b: "We will never subjugate ourselves to proles!"

rhein.federals.29.t: "Social Democracy's Future"
rhein.federals.29.d: "The failure of the social democrats to prevent the rise of Valkism is no doubt one that will be looked upon as one of the most shameful chapters of the party’s long history. Even more so will be the rampant collaboration between the brutish Valkists and hyper-nationalist tendencies within the party, which can only be deemed as a monstrous betrayal of democracy and the republic. Be that as it may, the reality of Bolshevism and other more radical tendencies have only hardened the hearts of many social democrats to extremism - action is needed, but not violence!\n\nComing to the foray is the relationship between the social democrats and the communists. Standing against liberal democracy and the republic, the KPD were arguably just as culpable as the Valkists they claimed to oppose in the fall of the republic. This line of thought has inspired much vigorous debate within the SPD, surely Valkism could not have taken hold if a united front of the proletariat had taken hold?"
rhein.federals.29.a: "We cannot slip into more radicalism."
rhein.federals.29.b: "Only the united power of the workers will stop Valkism!"

rhein.federals.30.t: "The Liberal Reconciliation"
rhein.federals.30.d: "With the republic’s restoration, German liberalism had to decide its next move. The division of the liberal parties into two squabbling parties of the middle class was undoubtedly one of the great failures of the November revolution and a great regret of the republic’s greatest statesman, Gustav Stresemann.\n\nNow with elections coming soon, the liberal parties have seen this as the chance to once and for all come together for a united front of German liberalism. The Democratic Party and People’s Party have united around a liberal principle for Germany as well as the dual victory of both the German state and people, whether they be from the working class or at the very top. Coalescing into a new German State People’s Party, many see this as a potential indicator of the revival of liberalism as a force in German politics."

With not merely the Rhineland, but Germany as a whole at a crossroads in her history, many predict that these elections will prove to be the most fateful since 1932.

rhein.federals.32.t: "The New Liberal Movement"
rhein.federals.32.d: "The head of the revitalized liberal movement being a staunch separatist has shocked many, but for Dorten it is simply a transition into something new. With his party successfully rallying the liberal middle class and new winds in German politics, Dorten has rebranded the DFP, a \"product of crisis\" into a more generic Democratic Party of Germany - DPD.\n\nThe name however fails to truly capture the new line of liberal politics. Advocating still for a continued decentralization of the states as well as the total annihilation of Prussian influence from policy, this new party may well signal the entrenchment of separatism in German life for the foreseeable future."
rhein.federals.32.a: "Interesting times abound."

# Same as rhein.federals.26
rhein.federals.33.d: "New elections have come around. While the last ones were no doubt the most significant since the end of the old republic, these new elections are still nevertheless just as hotly contested with parties on all sides seeing this as their opportunity to rise to unprecedented relevance."

rhein.federals.34.d: "With the elections over, the time has come for us to pick our coalition partner for the new government. Many parties vye for some influence in future decision-making as German democracy continues its great work of bringing about freedom, unity and justice to all. Still, too many partners may not create a viable government, forcing us to decide what our next move shall be."
rhein.federals.34.a: "The liberals will aid our agenda."

rhein.federals.34.c: "We need a coalition from the left to the right."
rhein.federals.34.c: "Times are tough - reform the grand coalition!"

rhein.federals.35.t: "The Outraged Left"
rhein.federals.35.d: "The line between social democracy and true socialism has historically remained rather vague. This is quite apparent in the SPD, the current ruling party which is now experiencing internal friction due to it. Our government’s recent policies have seemingly signalled an apparent turn to the right among the left-wing of the SPD, which has incurred hostility from their faction. While we could appease them by slowing down supposed ‘rightist’ policy, such a concession may very well harm our ability to work with the center and cause further internal division."
rhein.federals.35.a: "They are nothing more than tools of communists."
rhein.federals.35.b: "Appease them."

rhein.federals.36.t: "The Ghost of Spartakus"
rhein.federals.36.d: "The history between the SPD and the far-left in Germany has often been fraught, with betrayal at every corner by every party concerned. We now reach another potential point of friction between the German left, except it unfortunately seems to come from within. More moderate elements in the party have made clear their displeasure at our supposed turn to radicalism, which now opens the door to halting any process of proletarian unity in Germany. While they are right that the far left have not always held the democratic process as important, some urge us to continue down this route lest we repeat the errors of old and alienate the German proletariat."
rhein.federals.36.a: "We will not make the mistakes of the past."
rhein.federals.36.b: "They have a point..."

rhein.federals.37.t: "The Removal of Valkists"
rhein.federals.37.d: "There is no greater stain on the history of social democracy as is the defection of many of them to the Valkist movement. Fooled into believing the false god of Dressler, their defection has done nothing but bring shame upon the German worker as well as make the process of de-Valkification far more difficult.\n\nThis now ends. From today onwards, only the most banal members of the Valkist organization and their tyrannical crew may be re-accepted into the SPD. All former elements who cooperated with the Valkist scourge, whether they be high-ranking bureaucrats or lowly party members, shall be purged from the party - down with Valkism!"
rhein.federals.37.a: "Their betrayal will be remembered as it should be."

rhein.federals.38.t: "The Revolution Unleashed"
rhein.federals.38.d: "The time has come for the revolution to take the next step. With the social democratic movement now firmly trained towards the unity of all workers against the dual hydras of capitalism and Valkism, the now-former chancellor has resigned. In his stead, Otto Grotewohl has been appointed chancellor as Germany now readies herself to continue the good work of a democracy for and by the people."
rhein.federals.38.a: "The spirit of 1919 has returned!"

rhein.federals.39.t: "The Communist Question"
rhein.federals.39.d: "As much as the failure of the republic can be put at the feet of the far-right, who destabilized democracy before engaging in a total dictatorial overthrow of the republic, much of the blame can also be put on the communists. The KPD and its sister parties were all just as anti-republican as the Valkists they proclaim to hate, indulging themselves as the ‘only true anti-Valkist party’.\n\nThis treachery ought to be punished. The communists certainly still remain no friend of democracy and in many ways still cling on to the desire to see a Soviet Germany where the true master is Moscow. Still, perhaps we should not be too hasty? Many still remember their cooperation in fighting Valkism, aid that was sorely needed in a time of unprecedented crisis."
rhein.federals.39.a: "They betrayed the republic - and will get what they deserve."
rhein.federals.39.b: "This is a bit much, is it not?"

rhein.federals.40.t: "The Liberal Merger"
rhein.federals.40.d: "With the creation of a new republican government on the Rhine, it seems that the rump DVP have lost their patience with the Democrats. Working with the rather minor yet influential Rhenish People's Association, the DVP and RV have sent shockwaves through the political system with news of their merger into a singular party.\n\nWith such an action seeming totally out of place for the national liberals of the DVP, many have speculated as to how the merger was even let through. Whether it be due to pressure by the industrial magnates of the former mandate or sympathy with Dorten’s strict anti-socialism, there is little doubt that now, a new liberal party shall fight towards a free Germany."

Whether it be Dorten and his long past with the French authorities, or Matthes and his inept bungling of much of the aid granted to him, the Rhineland separatists have often lost much in return for little gain for their French benefactors.\n\nHailing from a working class background, Josef Smeets made a name for himself as one of the foremost radicals of the separatist movement. Originally a politician for the Independent Social Democrats, Smeets would soon hop onto the seemingly growing separatist movement, gaining aid from the Belgians to set up an ostensibly socialist, mainly revolutionary separatist party. Having floated in mainly irrelevancy during the years of the mandate, Smeets would survive many assassination attempts and with the rise of the separatist movement has gained a second wind in popularity. Besides him, other prominent socialists like Carl Leidner and Georg Kunz also spread the call for socialism along with the Rhineland's independence from Prussia - making our relations with London and Paris difficult."

Besides the usual pamphlets and broadcasts, Valkist speakers have begun making demonstrations, angrily denouncing us and at times even inciting people to riot and launch the Rhine into chaos.

As far as Mexico and as close as Switzerland, we must continue to work towards the resistance and eventual destruction of Valkist Germany and to do so requires their aid.\n\nHowever, some bemoan our request to overseas Germans as lap dog behaviour, with separatists especially despising the idea that the Rhineland will take the mantle of the anti-Valkist Germany.

Another has been Switzerland, a nation famed for its neutrality.\n\nIn not only these states but many others, these émigrés have faced nothing but trouble in rallying any kind of anti-Valkist movement, even if such movements seem obviously beneficial to us. Nevertheless, the resoluteness of the true German state has called them to action.

With the social democrats, now known as SoPaDe having suffered continuous disasters since the Valkist takeover in 1932, funding would soon become a major worry for the party that led the November revolution.\n\nTo alleviate this, a \"German Labour Delegation\" would be set up in New York City, aiming to raise funds and support for the exiled social democrats through connections with the American labour movement. However, this delegation has not been as successful as hoped - most especially because of leftist division.\n\nLong-time chairman of the Allgemeiner freier Angestelltenbund, Siegfried Aufhäuser would begin to call within the SoPaDe for an alliance with their arch-nemesis in the communists for an anti-valkist movement against Berlin. For this, Aufhäuser would soon find himself expelled from the social democrats, but nevertheless he alongside Karl Böchel continue to agitate from America for a more leftist SPD - all with the goal of the overthrow and destruction of [GER.GetLeader]’s wicked regime."

Whilst our inquiries seemingly fall on deaf ears, our left-wing allies against valkism have indicated that this is likely out of some sense of mutual opposition to Berlin’s desire to subjugate Germany under an unfeeling, uncaring government that only seeks to eliminate democracy and freedom from this earth.

rhein.flavor.14.d: "Whilst it would be hard to say that no courage is needed for any German to resist valkism in our free Rhineland, it would be totally impossible to measure just how courageous some among us are. Within the rotten Reich, there lay some brave souls who venture out of their way to help us and sabotage Berlin’s attempts to destroy Europe.\n\nOne among them is Carlo Mierendorff, a former social democrat. Having laid low following his brutal incarceration in the aftermath of Dressler’s takeover, Mierendorff has remained in Germany, making connections with other anti-government elements in a bid to overthrow and restore Germany’s freedom. In spite of these tough conditions, he has successfully raised some funds and most importantly intelligence for us in free Germany to use when the time comes once and for all to throw Berlin from its golden throne."
rhein.flavor.14.a: "Brave..."

rhein.flavor.15.t: "The Koblenz Regime"
rhein.flavor.15.d: "With Europe edging closer and closer to war, it seems that [RHI.GetNameDef] has reached out to us, asking us to recognize them as a legitimate government in the face of Germany. Even if their cause is just, there is little denying that this will bind us closer to containing Germany and may permanently torpedo relations with them for the foreseeable future."
rhein.flavor.15.a: "We stand for democracy!"
rhein.flavor.15.b: "Discreetly show our support."
rhein.flavor.15.c: "Let's not risk Berlin's wrath for a hopeless cause."

rhein.flavor.16.t: "[FROM.GetName] recognizes us!"
rhein.flavor.16.d: "As hoped for, [FROM.GetName] has recognized us as a responsible and legitimate government in the Rhineland. Berlin’s claim to the Rhine has in essence been weakened and we in turn gain more allies against the threat of German expansion."
rhein.flavor.16.a: "Huzzah!"

rhein.flavor.17.t: "[FROM.GetName] accepts us!"
rhein.flavor.17.d: "We have received a reply from [FROM.GetName] that suggests that they will tacitly accept our claim as the responsible and legitimate Rhenish government, but that they are not able to fully recognize us. Whilst undoubtedly disappointing, such a move should have been expected."
rhein.flavor.17.a: "Better than nothing..."

rhein.flavor.18.t: "[FROM.GetName] ignores us!"
rhein.flavor.18.d: "Unfortunately, it seems that [FROM.GetName] has ignored our request, leaving us to the dogs in Berlin. Whilst they may not necessarily be pro-German, it cannot be denied that this has dealt a major blow to the prospect of containing Germany."
rhein.flavor.18.a: "Do they not realize their foolishness?"

rhein.flavor.19.t: "The Eagle and the Rooster"
rhein.flavor.19.d: "Even though we have secured the Rhenish people’s freedom and independence for years to come, there are some who seemingly disagree with the notion of a free Rhenish state. Revolted at our beneficial French ties, Pan-Germanists have taken it upon themselves to expel French influence, in turn causing the French to grow more distrustful of us. If we are to keep the Rhineland free, we must tread lightly..."
rhein.flavor.19.a: "This does not bode well..."
RHI_random_anti_separatists: "§YDue to the public's icy opinion on separatism, we will randomly be harrassed by radicals, well-meaning or otherwise.§!"

rhein.flavor.20.t: "[FROM.GetName] asks for weapons"
rhein.flavor.20.d: "We have received a request from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that would have us send them military equipment for them to use to build up their defences. Whilst this has the advantage of reinforcing the anti-Valkist bulwark, it may come at the more important cost of our defence."
rhein.flavor.20.a: "Let us strengthen our buffer."
rhein.flavor.20.b: "Nonsense, we can handle the Germans ourselves."

rhein.flavor.21.t: "[FROM.GetName] aids us!"
rhein.flavor.21.d: "Thankfully, [FROM.GetName] has accepted our request for arms, boosting our efforts to build up a force that can resist Germany’s attempts to bring us into their decaying, tyrannical empire."
rhein.flavor.21.a: "To liberty!"

rhein.flavor.22.t: "[FROM.GetName] refuses us!"
rhein.flavor.22.d: "Sadly, it seems that [FROM.GetName] has refused to grant us any kind of weaponry, leaving us to produce our own weaponry. Even if they do not realize it, this will not bode well for a war against Berlin."
rhein.flavor.22.a: "Their loss."

rhein.flavor.23.t: "Terror on the Rhine"
rhein.flavor.23.d: "Once known for its tranquility and peaceful nature, the Rhine has seen less bloody days. With polarization between French forces and local Germans reaching an all-time high, there can be no doubt that the free Rhenish state is not in a state to resist any kind of attack - let alone one by Germany.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed in either Paris nor Berlin, recent reports have indicated that troops have already begun to mass along the Rhine with both powers seeming closer than ever to war with the other. Either way, it seems that the Rhenish state may soon enter a dark period in its history..."
rhein.flavor.23.a: "This is bad."

rhein.flavor.24.t: "The French Takeover"
rhein.flavor.24.d: "It appears that Berlin has blinked first.\n\nWith French influence at an all-time high, it would not take long before the Tricolour would find itself waving along the streets of Koblenz and Aachen. With the government no longer able to maintain order, the French have opted to simply move in and ensure that order reigns. As government offices find themselves under French control, many have also realized that the French have opted to commandeer much of Rhenish industry and seem on the verge of taking control of virtually every part of the state.\n\nThe reality is that the Rhineland is no longer free. The supposed [RHI.GetName] has now become nothing more than a protectorate, dominated by the French who now prepare to turn the Rhineland into a redoubt against German expansionism. Even despite their seething hatred of these events, Berlin can ill-afford to bash its head against the new Rhenish fortress as the only fate that now befalls the Rhineland is one of exploitation."
rhein.flavor.24.a: "Shame..."

rhein.flavor.25.t: "Anarchy on the Rhine"
rhein.flavor.25.d: "Things have utterly collapsed.\n\nWith a very loose coalition of pan-German groups vying for dominance, such an outcome should have been expected. Yet, few realized just what would be the outcome of their victory. With the old government now all but on paper, the many cities on the Rhine from Aachen to Cologne to Ludwigshafen have begun to fall into anarchy. As petty cliques engage in shootouts across the street, terrorists from the communist and valkist groups have already begun declaring governments to launch forth a revolution in the Rhineland.\n\nBut there will be no such revolution. The simple fact is that the state has failed and that the Rhineland is essentially doomed. The only thing that remains to be seen is whether or not Germany or France will swoop in first to rescue the civilians from this state of affairs..."
rhein.flavor.25.a: "..."

rhein.flavor.26.t: "Berlin on the Hunt"
rhein.flavor.26.d: "Even if we would like to keep ourselves out of Germany, it seems that Germany cannot stick their nose elsewhere. Once more, Germany has proclaimed their ambitions to the world, desiring to not only overturn Versailles but to also destroy the liberal world order that has given humanity so much.\n\nEven though this is not a declaration of war, many have begun treating it as the first step towards a much bigger conflict. Some even believe that Germany may first strike us before anyone else, making preparations for the grand conflict even more urgent. No matter when or where Germany strikes, we would do well to watch."
rhein.flavor.26.a: "Worrying."

rhein.flavor.27.t: "The Valkist Strike"
rhein.flavor.27.d: "So it goes.\n\nFrom their loudspeakers and from their podiums, the Germans speak of an "Hour of Destiny", one where they finally overturn the world order set in 1919 and one that has presided over Germany’s growth and recovery from the war. Yes, there were many missteps and mishandlings, but it was one where the average German lived better than during the archaic days of the Kaiserreich. But now the Reich seeks to steal more, unsatiated with the freedom of Germany, they now must consume and destroy the freedom of all of Europe.\n\nWith Germany now ready to once more enter a cataclysmic war of conquest against Europe, they have set their sights on us. Ready and willing to crush us into dust and smother what’s remaining of free Germany, we must be ready to stand against them. Even if we are all Germans, we will make sure they pay for every inch of land they claim to \"liberate\"."
rhein.flavor.27.a: "Es lebe die Freiheit!"
rhein.flavor.27.tr: "§LLong live freedom!§!"
RHI_disable_bop_push: "All missions in the balance of power will be cancelled"

rhein.flavor.28.t: "The Parisian Dreamers"
rhein.flavor.28.d: "The main driver behind the mandate’s creation, the role of the French on the Rhine has often been a source of fear, pride or resentment for all powers involved. With exaggerated fears of French annexation, Paris has had to play a careful balancing act to neither aggravate London nor their domestic nationalists. Luckily for them, they would not be alone in their wish for an autonomous Rhineland, away from Berlin’s dominion.\n\nA former solicitor in the Prussian administration, Hans Adam Dorten would grow to resent the administration that he had served, being mobilized in 1914 and returning from the Great War with a near-psychotic hatred of all things Prussian. Soon, Dorten would dedicate himself to the cause of Rhenish separatism. Following several failed attempts to gain popularity for himself, Dorten would soon find a benefactor in the French, who generously lent him aid at every possible point. Staunchly opposed to any cooperation with the social democrats, Dorten would find himself isolated from most of the political establishment, resulting in his creation of the ‘Rhenish People’s Association’ - an extra-parliamentary organization built for the sole purpose of forwarding Dorten’s ideal for a free Rhenish state. Having found little support amongst the Rhenish public, Dorten wields significant influence amongst the scant few middle-class separatists and as such still is able to command some support from the French.\n\nNevertheless, Dorten’s inability to rally much public support has proven a major deal breaker for the French, who much prefer Josef Friedrich Matthes. A former journalist, Matthes came from a lower-class background and would spend the first few years following Germany’s defeat in the Great War roaming the country, avoiding lawsuits and starting newspapers. Having become a part of the French administration, Matthes would run a black market for tobacco, becoming an editor for the French press in the mandate and soon gaining support among the numerous unemployed and downtrodden workers in the Rhineland. Despite the failure of the first United Rhineland movement, Matthes would continue agitating for a freer Rhenish state - though he has mostly gained the reputation as a French tool amongst those who remain unsympathetic to separatism.\n\nOwing their few political successes to French backing, the Rhenish separatists have not earned a glowing reputation across the mandate - with scandals over their French benefactors being frequent and expected. Many even believe that once the mandate ends, the separatists will find themselves as a sinking treasure ship with no sails."
rhein.flavor.28.a: "If only they weren’t so incompetent..."

rhein.flavor.29.t: "No More Truce"
rhein.flavor.29.d: "With the end of the struggle against Valkism and the wretched tyrants of Berlin and Munich, the political truce between the many parties has come to an end. While this was no doubt expected, it is still nevertheless quite unfortunate that free Germans are still unable to overcome petty differences."
rhein.flavor.29.a: "Alright..."

rhein.flavor.30.t: "The Unthinkable?"
rhein.flavor.30.d: "With free Germany currently in a mortal struggle for her survival, some have called for a truce with the communists of Germany. Having been an active thorn in our side at the best of times and a threat to Germany’s stability and freedom at the worst, the communists have seemingly scaled down their activities against us with the current war.\n\nAs such, some of our government has called for a truce to be made with the communists. Until Valkism has been vanquished from Germany, they and us will cooperate as far as possible for the ultimate destruction of the Berlin regime. Although this has already been decried as blatant opportunism by some, times are dark and we will certainly need all the help we can get in the struggle."
rhein.flavor.30.a: "In these times, nothing is off the table."
rhein.flavor.30.b: "NEVER!"

rhein.flavor.31.t: "Communist Denial"
rhein.flavor.31.d: "Rather myopically, the communists have denied our request for a truce with the usual revolutionary tone - with a rather puzzling lack of self-preservation clear in their response. As such, we will have to deal with the dual hydras of the red scourge as well as the green one too."
rhein.flavor.31.a: "As should have been expected."

rhein.flavor.32.t: "A United Front"
rhein.flavor.32.d: "Surprisingly, the communists have agreed to our request for a truce per their apparent turn in doctrine. Already, communist agitation has shifted away from their anti-republican messaging and the KPD has already begun speaking in our favour both in Germany and abroad."
rhein.flavor.32.a: "Everything against Valkism!"

rhein.flavor.33.t: "Beginning of the Valkist Trials"
rhein.flavor.33.d: "With the restoration of justice to Germany and the smiting of the hydra known as Valkism, it is high time for us to begin punishing these thugs for their crimes against the German people and all known decency. With the support of the international community, the courts have now ordered the infamous Valkists of the old Reich to trial. Many onlookers have already begun making predictions as to what the verdict will be - death, imprisonment or acquittal? Some have even gone so far as to say that the trials will leave a mark on whether Germany can truly move beyond Valkism - will it, can it or should it?"
rhein.flavor.33.a: "Let us get to work!"

rhein.flavor.34.t: "The Valkist Trials: Leaders"
rhein.flavor.34.d: "As the trials begin, many across Germany and the world have begun watching with great interest as to how we will try the leaders of the Valkist nation. Whether they claim to not be \"real valkists\" like Artur Mahraun or they proclaim their martyrdom like Ernst von Salomon, many are itching to know whether it shall be the noose or eternal disgrace that shall punish these grand losers.\n\nOn one hand, punishing them with the death penalty is certainly called for. It is not like they would not have done the same thing to us. However, some urge caution as these Valkist traitors still command great respect from many in Germany and their execution may cause a stir."
rhein.flavor.34.a: "Hang them all!"
rhein.flavor.34.b: "Show leniency to just the repentant."

rhein.flavor.35.t: "The Valkist Trials: Reichswehr"
rhein.flavor.35.d: "Next on the stand are the Reichswehr generals. The names of many supposed \"heroes\" have been read out to the court - Rundstedt, Bock, Kluge, Guderian and so on. Denounced by the court as traitors to Germany, few think that they will be able or even willing to return to active duty and especially not command of the current Reichswehr.\n\nHowever, some civilian leaders have gone a step further, urging that this opportunity be used to ensure that the Reichswehr will no longer act as the bulwark of reaction in the new republic. A republicanization of the military has long been desired - and this trial could prove the spark for such a programme. This of course has been rejected by many existing Reichswehr officers - who themselves may be purged as a result. Furthermore, the disgraced officers have spoken out not just to the court, but to the press here and abroad, speaking rather surprisingly of having been opposed to Dressler’s plans at every step of the way. Although their veracity in being oppositional is questionable, many have eaten up their story, making a harsh punishment harsh on us as well. In any event, what verdict does the court decide on?"
rhein.flavor.35.a: "They have disgraced Germany and themselves."
rhein.flavor.35.b: "They can be forgiven."
rhein.flavor.35.c: "The Stormtroopers are the ones responsible!"

rhein.flavor.36.t: "The Valkist Trials: Reichsgruppe Industrie"
rhein.flavor.36.d: "Despite their programme of defaced Bolshevism, the Valkists and their allies managed to enlist the cooperation or at least obedience of much of German industry. This might be understandable had we not been present, but the existence of a German exile government demonstrates that at their core, the Reichsgruppe Industrie and their associates are nothing more than profit-driven cowards.\n\nWith large corporate figures like Gustav Krupp and Hjalmar Schacht on trial, many wonder if the verdict will be harsh upon the accused. Coming out in defence for the accused have been the liberal establishment and other magnates of industry and finance, with Paul Silverberg even writing a personal letter to [ROOT.GetLeader] pleading clemency. On the side of accusers, socialists of all stripes have declared the industrialists guilty as charged, pointing to them as not just enablers, but pushers of the Valkist regime. In spite of all of this, what shall the court decide?"
rhein.flavor.36.a: "They shall face justice."
rhein.flavor.36.b: "They were coerced - let them off."
rhein.flavor.36.c: "Punish only the worst offenders."

rhein.flavor.37.t: "Thorough De-Valkification?"
rhein.flavor.37.d: "As the trials wrap up, some both in Germany but especially overseas have urged not just punishment for the top, but also the clearing out of the potential hidden cadres of Valkists throughout society. Many suffer the terrorism of the Werwolf, who hide in the alleys, sewers and forests of Germany in filth and dirt to unleash their hatred upon society. A thorough questioning of potential Valkist party members, along with a cleansing of bureaucracy and public life of Valkists could also go a long way in protecting the new Germany.\n\nOn the other hand, such a notion is terribly unpopular in Germany. After all, the current government struggled its way to this position - does it really need to butt into every citizen’s affairs to ensure their political alignment? Is that not a Valkist thing to do? While the streets, plazas and buildings may no longer hold the heraldry of Valkism, should we go one step further to ensure that this noxious ideology never returns?"
rhein.flavor.37.a: "We are not tyrants."
rhein.flavor.37.b: "We must ensure this rot infects society no longer!"

rhein.flavor.38.t: "Issue of the Railways"
rhein.flavor.38.d: "The railways of the old Weimar state were taken under the wing of the government, being coagulated and directed by one massive state-run entity known as the Deutsche Reichsbahn. With this, the Reichsbahn would be tied to the state - and soon it was tied to the Valkist state. Under the control of the Valkists, the Reichsbahn would soon be one of the foremost \"coordinated\" institutions in Dressler’s Reich.\n\nNow Dressler is gone, but the railways have gone nowhere. While retaking control of the Reichsbahn has been deemed by many as the most practical outcome, other more liberal-minded individuals have urged for privatizing the railways and making them less susceptible to authoritarian tendencies."
rhein.flavor.38.a: "Take control of them."
rhein.flavor.38.b: "More government intervention?"

rhein.flavor.40.t: "Schleicher’s Legacy"
rhein.flavor.40.d: "With Schleicher leaving the picture, the fate of the new government, unchained from republican notions of freedom and democracy has now been put into question. While many agree that the republic shall not make a return, few can agree on what the next step forward for new Germany is. The Reichswehr have put forth a recommendation that a new totalitarian \"Wehrstaat\" - defence state must be created to prepare Germany for the inevitable third clash between Germany and her enemies. Some of course reject this as destabilizing to the future of Germany - a new state that eventually will replace the republic must be created with the aristocracy at the top as they rightfully were. There too are moderates who believe both to be too far gone for the republic we restored - a new republic that will ensure socialism, Valkism and all derivatives of Marxism are relegated to the past should be established. Whatever the choice is however, it will shape Germany for the year to come.\n\nSo then, what shall it be?"
rhein.flavor.40.a: "The Defence State must be realized!"
rhein.flavor.40.b: "The republic must be destroyed entirely!"
rhein.flavor.40.c: "A new, popular order is called for."

rhein.flavor.41.t: "The French Invasion"
rhein.flavor.41.d: "The French have always been among the German people’s most determined foes. Few in our government can claim to hold much admiration of them beyond cultural ties, and in any event their imperialistic and domineering tendencies are the greatest roadblocks to the dream of European unity.\n\nNow the fears of French intervention have come true, as troops led by general Charles Mangin have marched in and raised the Tricolour. With the government unable to forcefully resist both France and the practically guaranteed coming German intervention thereof, the French have found their occupation to be relatively swift and bloodless. As government offices find themselves under French control, many have also realized that the French have opted to commandeer much of Rhenish industry.\n\nThe Rhineland has lost its freedom, with the government’s only purpose being to turn the Rhineland into a redoubt against German expansionism. Even despite their seething hatred of these events, Berlin can ill-afford to bash its head against the new Rhenish fortress as the only fate that now befalls the Rhineland is one of exploitation."

How could the puny Rhineland match the German juggernaut with its overwhelming superiority in strength and determination?\n\nHowever, some brave souls spit in the face of surrender to the Prussian yoke. The Rhineland is the frontier of democracy, and so it shall be! Faced with the looming French giant and the resentment thereof, the Rhenish government must not only balance the many undeniable benefits Paris can grant us, but also their creeping influence in the Rhine.\n\nOr perhaps we must not worry about this? After all, many Germans will independently balk at any further French dealing; most especially if they erroneously believe us to be French tools. Either way, we must gain favour, which is represented by §2Separatist Sentiments§! that currently measure at [RHI_separatist_sentiment_sl]. As we must gradually gain favour with the Rhenish people, we must use some of this sentiment to improve our image, to the world and to our people.\n\n[RHI_separatist_power_struggle]"

Whether they be local or from Germany, they desire to take the former mandate beyond another conquered territory for the Reich to the east. With both §GSeparatists§! and §RRepublicans§! looking to take the reigns of power, the highly influential §CKonrad Adenauer§! and his Centre allies play kingmaker and perhaps may even seek to take the throne for themselves.
