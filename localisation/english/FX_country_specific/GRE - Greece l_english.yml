GRE_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "With our successful campaign against the Turks, the dream of Megáli Idéa has been realized and our status has been secured. Our Ethnarch and incumbent leader Elefthérios Venizélos, having sidelined the opposition with his popular reforms rules with a velvet glove.\n\nHowever the abysmal economic situation, the slow economic withering of Smyrna and Hellenization policies have caused wide unrest within our country. Elections are coming, and only time will tell what will happen to the Nation of the Hellenes."

#### Political Parties ####
GRE_vanguardist_party: "KAKE"
GRE_vanguardist_party_long: "Kommounistikó Archeiomarxistikó Kómma Elládas \n§gThe Communist Archio-Marxist Party of Greece is a communist political party in Greece, active from 1934. It belongs to a subgenre of Marxism–Leninism and Trotskyism known as Archeio-Marxism (Archive-Marxism) and appears to have been the last scion of that ideology. Its leader, Dimitrios Giotopoulos, also known by his primary alias "Witte", is the leader of the KAKE. Before its formation, he had been a leader of the Greek Archio-Marxists, which had been one of the by far largest dissident communist movements in Greece during the early-to-mid-1930s, as members of Leon Trotsky's "Left Opposition". KAKE split from Trotsky's movement in 1934 after significant ideological fallout. While overshadowed by the major Communist Party, KAKE continues its activites as it waits for the proper moment to assert itself as the true successor of socialism, even though rumors claim that Giotopoulos is collaborating with the right.§!\n\n§WHead of Government:§!

Founded in 1920, Gounaris and his parliamentary candidates campaigned for the withdrawal of the Hellenic Army from Asia Minor, which it occupied under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres in the aftermath of World War I. Failing to win the 1920 election against the Venizelists and the subsequent victory in the Greco-Turkish war, the party suffered great losses and was in the brink of dissolution, only saved through Gounaris' political maneuvering.

##### Leader Description ####
POLITICS_PAPANASTASIOU_DESC: "Papanastasiou was born on 8 July 1876 in Tripoli. He studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. From 1901 to 1905 he studied social sciences, law, and philosophy in Germany. In 1910 Papanastasiou was elected to the Greek Parliament for the first time. In 1916, he has joined the Provisional Government of National Defence in Thessaloniki. After the election crisis, he and other anti-monarchists published a document entitled The Republican-Democratic Manifesto.

gre.0.t: "The Second Hellenic Republic"
gre.0.d: "Greece emerged victorious from the 1912-1913 Balkan Wars with her territory almost doubled, but found iteself in a difficult international situation. In 1914 another danger would emerge from the Assasination of Franz Ferdinand, which Greece was allied with Serbia. Initially neutral, Venizelos supported participation with the Entente while the King anticipated a German victory. This led to a power struggle between Liberals and Royalists, where the King dismissed Venizelos unconstitutionally.\n\nFollowing other incidents and humiliations from the royalist Athens government, the State of National Defence was established in Thessaloniki to fight alongside the Allies. Venizelos instead of pursuing a more moderate path, decided that the monarchy had outlast its usefulness and set out to declare the Second Hellenic Republic. The division of the country lasted 9 months, as an Allied ultimatum forced the King and the Royal Family to flee in Switzerland.\n\nVenizelos returned to Athens, as head of a superficially reunified Greece, and led it to victory alongside the Allies in World War I, but also in its entanglement in the subsequent Asia Minor Campaign which led to the Partition of the Ottoman Empire and the ratification of the Treaty of Sèvres.\n\nThe following years saw success for Venizelos' Liberal Party, securing the majority in every election, reforms were pushed and the remaining royalist sentiments were purged from the Republic.\nHowever the economic situation couldn't be worse, as Smyrna doesn't have access to the raw materials of deep Anatolia and needs to rely on the other side for economic support, debts are skyrocketing and unrest starts to grow within the population. It's 1936 and with the rise of Valkism the Hellenic Republic is in a weak position. Will the nation of the Hellenes withstand against all odds?\n\n$gre.1.d$"

Extremist sentiment is also on the rise, with many flocking to either side hoping to see radical changes... with the establishment fearing that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."

While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."

gre.7.d: "Today a military garrison in Smyrna has received a bizarre offer from our "friends" in the Golden Dawn. They have offered a handful of military equipment for a meager price.

At this point, young people are running away from school only to contribute to acts of vandalism. This seems to be a minor issue, but this year we have seen a significant increase in support for Golden Dawn. Should we intervene?"

gre.20.t: "An Interesting Proposition"
gre.20.d: "Ever since we crushed the Ottoman madness we have had problems managing the various rebellions in our territories in Anatolia. This problem has become even more apparent as the war is getting closer. But the solution to this problem may be simpler than we think - let's ask Golden Dawn for help!

gre.13.t: "An Another Day in Thessaloniki"
gre.13.d: "The city of Thessaloniki has a large Jewish minority and, of course, with it, there are unfortunately anti-Semitic tendencies. Acts of violence against people of other nationalities are the order of the day here. We found evidence of Golden Dawn's intervention in this problem. Today another boundary was crossed. Two thugs tried to start a fire in a synagogue while shouting pro-Golden Dawn sentences. The worst thing is that there were witnesses to this situation and if the media finds out about it, we are really screwed."

The "Association of Hellenism" is growing every year. They have gathered all the known ancient beliefs and compressed them into one religious canon called "Hellenism". Maybe we should recognize our ancient beliefs as an official religion in Greece? On the other hand, the Christian majority of Greece could get very angry with our recognition."

gre.14.b: "You'd better find a good psycho facility for them instead"

gre.15.t: "The End"
gre.15.d: "We have made a mistake. A mistake that will cost thousands of lives. Golden Dawn has stormed government buildings in Athens, effectively taking control of the city. A few hours and the Republic will be gone. We can't fight anymore. Soldiers loyal to the Republic will start guerrilla warfare against the nationalists. The Entente knows about the situation, but it looks like it is not in their interest to intervene."
gre.15.a: "Glory to the Greek Underground State!"

gre.23.t: "The Coup"
gre.23.d: "The Golden Dawn, a political party known for its far-right ideology, recently gained control of the government through a coup, overthrowing the previous administration. Their ascent to power was met with mixed reactions, as their policies and actions have been a subject of controversy.\nHowever, tensions escalated further when the EEE (National Union "Hellas"), a rival political faction, decided to stage their own coup against the newly established Golden Dawn government. With the EEE aiming to seize power, the stakes were high, and the outcome of this power struggle was uncertain.\nThe EEE's coup attempt drew attention and support from various segments of society dissatisfied with the Golden Dawn's rise to power. These dissidents hoped that the EEE's coup would succeed in toppling the government, bringing about a change in leadership and policies.\nAs the coup unfolded, the nation faced a period of heightened political instability and unrest. The streets were filled with protesters, both supporting and opposing the coup attempts, leading to clashes and demonstrations throughout the country. The military's stance in this power struggle became crucial, as their loyalty could sway the balance of power.\News outlets closely followed the events, speculating on the potential outcomes and implications of the coup. International observers expressed concerns about the situation, monitoring the developments and considering potential responses.\nHowever, due to the complexity and fluidity of coup attempts, it is challenging to determine the exact outcome. The fate of the EEE's coup against the Golden Dawn government remains uncertain, and the country holds its breath, waiting to see if the new administration will be overthrown or if the Golden Dawn will successfully quell the rebellion and maintain their grip on power."

After extensive negotiations, the Serbian government accepted the agreement, recognizing its importance for shared security and regional stability. The signing ceremony marked a milestone in bilateral relations, solidifying their commitment to support each other in times of need. This agreement established frameworks for military cooperation, joint exercises, information sharing, and coordinated defense strategies between the two countries."

gre.25.t: "The Greco-Serbian Mutual Defence Agreement"
gre.25.d: "Despite efforts made by the Greek Foreign Minister to strengthen the alliance between Greece and Serbia, the Serbian government ultimately refused to sign the proposed mutual defense agreement. Despite the recognition of their shared interests as allies, Serbia expressed reservations or concerns that prevented them from accepting the agreement at that time. As a result, the signing ceremony did not take place, leaving the defense cooperation between the two countries in a state of uncertainty."
gre.25.b: "Damn"

gre.37.t: "Zaimis Dead"
gre.37.d: "The Austrian Ambassador delivered somber news today, announcing the passing of President Alexandros Zaimis of the Republic at 3:30 am. President Zaimis had been transported to Vienna for ophthalmological treatment, although it remains uncertain if this was directly related to his death. Speculations vary, with some suggesting foul play while others believe it was due to natural causes. In response, our Ethnarch Eleftherios Venizelos, who serves as the Prime Minister of Hellas, addressed the nation, informing them of the President's demise. Acting swiftly, Venizelos has assumed both the role of President and Prime Minister, maintaining control until the Liberal Committee convenes to determine the next President. There are rumors circulating that an election may not take place and instead a new President will be appointed. Many fear that this unfortunate event may mark the beginning of the end for the republic, as there is a concern that extremists and ultranationalists might exploit the situation and attempt to seize power through a coup. The fragility of the current political landscape has heightened apprehensions about the future stability of the nation. It is a time of uncertainty and heightened vigilance as the country navigates through this challenging period."

gre.39.t: "The conference on the definition of Metaxism"
gre.39.d: "Today, Metaxas convened a conference to discuss the definition of Metaxism, titled "Declaration of the Ideological Principles of Metaxism." The core tenets of Metaxism were originally outlined in the 1930s in a book called "The Metaxism Manifesto." This ideology can be summarized as a Greek nationalist authoritarian ideology associated with Ioannis Metaxas, aimed at revitalizing the Greek nation and establishing a modern, culturally unified Hellenic Nation.\nMetaxism critiques Liberalism and individualism while drawing inspiration from elements commonly found in Valkist or National Populist movements. Its objective is to mobilize the Greek population as a disciplined collective in service of creating a new Hellenic State. Although some aspects of Metaxism align with National Populist ideologies, academically it is considered a distinct form of autocratic governance, incorporating principles from classical Conservatism, Monarchism, Valkism, and National Populist movements. The concept of the Third Greek Civilization, following the ancient Greek and Byzantine civilizations, serves as a unifying idea within Metaxism, albeit with differing interpretations among its various strains.\n\nNow, Metaxas aims to deepen the ideology of Metaxism. Which direction should he prioritize: Monarchism, National Populism, or Valkism?"

gre.40.t: "An Interesting Proposal"
gre.40.d: "As tensions escalate, the President of [GRE.GetName], [GRE.GetLeader], has reached a critical decision: to launch an attack on the Serbs. This outcome doesn't come as a surprise to many of us, as it has been a looming possibility. However, amidst this impending conflict, an intriguing alternative looms on the horizon—an opportunity to pursue a different path.\nCould we not, instead, seek an alliance with the Serbs and establish the visionary Greco-Serbian Confederation? The Serbs have long been our friends, and we share a common religion, reinforcing the deep-rooted bonds between our nations. It is a choice that demands our contemplation.\nBy embracing the Greco-Serbian Confederation, we can unlock tremendous potential. Collaboration, unity, and shared prosperity could flourish as we work hand in hand. Rather than engaging in military confrontation, we could foster diplomacy, economic cooperation, and cultural exchange. Our combined strengths and resources could transform us into a formidable force, ensuring stability and advancing our shared interests.\nNaturally, making such a monumental decision requires careful consideration of the risks and rewards at stake. We must seek a comprehensive understanding of the president's motivations for pursuing this attack on the Serbs. The complex web of international relations and geopolitical dynamics demands a judicious approach to address our nation's challenges and aspirations effectively.\nIt is incumbent upon us to engage in open and constructive dialogue, exploring alternative paths and advocating for a thorough examination of all options. By delving into the possibilities inherent in the Greco-Serbian Confederation and actively participating in shaping our nation's destiny, we can contribute to a more harmonious and prosperous future.\nWhat should we do?"

They stressed the need for Serbia to acknowledge and respect the diverse cultural and ethnic identities present within its borders. This call for inclusivity aimed to foster an environment of equality and harmony within the potential union.\nFurthermore, Greece proposed the involvement of Croatian and Slovenian representatives in the talks. By including these neighboring parties, Greece sought to ensure that all regions in the vicinity felt equally valued and included in the decision-making process. The intention was to avoid any potential feelings of abandonment or resentment that might lead to future conflicts. The Serbian delegates cautiously acknowledged this proposal, expressing their willingness to explore the possibility of involving additional stakeholders.\nThe hopes for a successful outcome of the talks soared as it became evident that both delegations were committed to the shared vision of the union. The negotiations took on a spirit of cooperation and understanding, as compromises were considered and mutual agreements began to take shape.\nAs the day drew to a close, the delegates adjourned, carrying with them a renewed sense of purpose and a commitment to advancing the negotiations.

With a newfound understanding, they commit to taking tangible steps towards fostering inclusivity and respect for diverse cultural and ethnic identities. This breakthrough instills a renewed sense of hope, as the foundation for a more harmonious and equitable union begins to take shape.\nIn a significant development, the Croatian and Slovenian delegations join the talks, answering Greece's call for broader participation. Their inclusion not only acknowledges the importance of their perspectives but also ensures that all relevant regional stakeholders have a voice in shaping the future. The delegates from Croatia and Slovenia contribute their insights and concerns, emphasizing the need for regional cooperation and solidarity.\nAs the negotiations progress, the discussions expand to encompass a myriad of topics. Economic integration plans are explored, with a focus on fostering trade, investment, and shared prosperity. Cultural collaboration becomes a central theme, with efforts to preserve and celebrate the rich heritage and traditions of all participating nations. Political alignment is discussed, aiming to establish a framework that ensures mutual support and cooperation on regional and international matters.\nHope is on the very high for citizens of both countries."

Grievances about inadequate representation and a perception of being marginalized have escalated, leading to clashes and unrest in Zagreb and Ljubljana.\nIn the aftermath of these disturbing events, a sense of urgency grips the confederation's leadership. The government is faced with a critical decision that could define the future of the union: whether to accept the demands of the Croat and Slovene communities and rename the confederation to the Greco-Yugoslav Confederation and grant some autonomy, or to reject their pleas and risk further escalation of the crisis.\nAmidst the intense clashes, a potential compromise begins to emerge. The government expresses willingness to address some of the concerns raised by the Croat and Slovene communities while upholding the core principles of the confederation. This may include provisions for greater regional autonomy in cultural and administrative matters while maintaining a unified framework for shared political, economic, and security objectives."

His contributions to Greece were not only transformative but also visionary, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's history.\nWords alone cannot fully express the profound impact Venizelos had on Greece and its people. He was not only an architect of the nation but a driving force behind its progress and development. One of his most remarkable achievements was leading Greece to victory in the Greco-Turkish War, a testament to his strategic brilliance and unwavering determination. By humbling the Turks, he solidified Greece's position as a regional power and earned the admiration and respect of his countrymen.\nVenizelos was not just a political figure; he was a revolutionary, a statesman, and a true pioneer in his field. His visionary leadership and bold ideas laid the foundation for modern Greece, shaping its political landscape and setting it on a path of prosperity. As the Ethnarch, he embodied the spirit of the nation, fiercely dedicated to the welfare of his people and the advancement of their interests.\nIn the wake of his passing, a week of mourning has been declared by our new caretaker Prime Minister, who has taken over the helm. As the nation grieves, it is essential to remember Venizelos as the uncompromising lionheart that he was. His legacy will continue to inspire future generations of Greeks to strive for greatness and to work tirelessly for the betterment of our beloved country. The loss of Eleftherios Venizelos is not just a personal tragedy; it is a loss for the entire nation. We shall honor his memory by cherishing his contributions and accomplishments, recognizing that his life's work has left an indelible imprint on Greece's history and identity.

He pledges to build upon the accomplishments of the previous administration and further advance our society. With his passion and understanding of governance, Sofoklis aims to create a more inclusive and prosperous future for our nation.\nMeanwhile, Themistoklis Sofoulis brings a different approach to the table.

While the Glücksburgs were once seen as the clear contenders, there is now another potential candidate on the horizon —Loukas Karreris.\nLoukas Karreris, a member of the House of Karrer, has a notable background that includes serving as the mayor of Zakynthos.

gre.96.d: "After his Emperorship the Emperor, ordered lethal force against the people, many have stopped raiding. Only a small group of people continue to raid against the government and still demand the return of Metaxas.

Some republican politicians are already preparing to flee Athens as monarchist sympathies in the MEK are high. But as of now the MEK has made no statements on the restoration of the king.

In the immediate aftermath a clique of Politicians, Military Leaders and Greek nobility have formed a council to restore the Greek Monarchy. Some may of a more conspiratorial nature would think that this was coordinated to facilitate the restoration however all evidence for this is simply circumstantial.

gre.120.t: "Epitaphios, Giannis Ritsos"
gre.120.d: "Well-known poet Giannis Ritsos, released today a new poem, called Epitaphios. He was inspired to write it after he had read about the strike of the tobbaco workers of Thessaloniki, in the newspaper Rizospastis. This peaceful protest had been drowned in blood by the government, with a total of twelve dead workers. The article included a photograph depicting a mother mourning over her dead child. This photo had a huge impact on Ritsos, and inspired him to write the poem:\n\nMy son, which Fate inscribed and which wrote for me\nsuch sorrow, such fire to ignite in my chest?\n\nDawn by dawn you woke me, you filled me, you bathed me,\nbefore the bell-ringer announced the morning far away.\n\nYou used to peer often and eagerly from the window\nand hurried as if there was a festival to attend.\n\nYour eyes were dark, your jaw clenched,\nand in your daring, sweet, bull and nightingale combined.\n\nAnd I, poor and carefree, I, the madwoman and the stray,\nI roasted sage for you, and my gaze kissed you lightly.\n\nOne by one your graces, your bright armor,\nand I rejoiced and laughed like a tender maiden.\n\nI never had a moment of resentment, nor did I run after\nto put my chest forward and shield the bullets.\n\nAnd it arrived late, oh, it never used to come at such an hour,\nand oh, better for the country to crumble into my embrace."

gre.121.t: "The Conquest of Constantinople"
gre.121.d: "It is May 29th, 1453. The ever-glorious bastion of Constantinople succumbed to the relentless onslaught of the Ottoman Turks. The air thick with the stench of death and despair, Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, a valiant martyr, breathed his last in defense of his beloved homeland, his blood mingling with the sacred soil of The City.\n\nOh, Almighty God, witness the sacrilege! The heathens have violated Your hallowed sanctuary, defiling the very essence of Your divine presence. How long, O Lord? How long must Your wrath smolder, a tempest of righteous fury? Pour forth Your divine retribution upon these unbelievers who have scorned Your name and trampled upon Your sovereignty. Let not our past transgressions obscure our plea for deliverance. Hear us, O King of Kings, in Your boundless mercy, for the sun weeps, and the earth trembles, echoing the lamentations of a fallen city!\n\nHush now, O Mother of God, cease your mournful wail, for though the city lies vanquished, hope shall yet rise from the ashes, and once again, shall it be adorned with the splendor of your grace. Amen.\n\nThe once-impregnable walls breached, countless souls sought refuge within the hallowed halls of Hagia Sophia, beseeching mercy from the unyielding grasp of the Ottomans. But mercy found no harbor amidst the invaders' hearts, as they tore down the gates of salvation and unleashed a torrent of bloodshed upon the masses.\n\n\nIt is [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]. Constantinople is finally ours. As the dawn breaks over the horizon, casting its golden rays upon the liberated streets of Constantinople, a fervent spirit of jubilation fills the air. Amidst the echoes of triumph, a solemn procession converges towards the venerable Hagia Sophia, its ancient walls bearing witness to centuries of tumult and transformation. With each step, the faithful carry not only the weight of their sorrows but also the fervent hope of a brighter tomorrow. As they gather within the sacred sanctuary, the hallowed halls resonate with the melody of the Akathist Hymn.\n\nLet the world take heed, for Constantinople has risen from the ashes of adversity, its spirit indomitable, its destiny irrevocably intertwined with the divine tapestry of history. And so, as the sun sets upon the sacred city, casting its radiant glow upon the domes and minarets that pierce the sky, let the hymns of praise resound, let the hearts of the faithful rejoice, for The City is ours once more, a beacon of hope and redemption in a world beset by darkness."
