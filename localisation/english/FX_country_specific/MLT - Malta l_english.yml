MLT_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "For centuries, Malta's storied history was marked by foreign dominion. From the Phoenicians to the Romans, Arabs, Normans, and the Knights of St. John, this resilient island nation was a coveted prize in the Mediterranean. British colonial rule brought both prosperity and challenges. The Maltese, valiant in the face of adversity, endured hardship and hardship. As war loomed into the horizon, and its strategic position in the Mediterranean, Malta is undoubtedly play its importance to the United Kingdom."

MLT_Future_desc: "Now Malta will decide it's future"

MLT_Strengthern_british_command: "Strengthern British Command"
MLT_Strengthern_british_command_desc: "The British Military in Malta is not strong enough so we will need to strengthern them to protect this tiny island from all external threats"
MLT_squesh_manpower: "Conscript Maltese Citizens"
MLT_squesh_manpower_desc: "With our position in the Mediterranean and close proximity to Italy, times of crisis and conflict are surely ahead. The need for adequate personnel becomes paramount. To ensure Malta's defense and stability, it is crucial to maximize available manpower. As a result, general conscription notices will be prepared and issued in phases. While conscription will lead to some resentment within our general population, a nation's strength and resilience depend on its manpower. With growing tensions far away on distant shores, it is necessary to move away from our dependence on volunteers to ensure Malta's defense readiness. We can also utilize conscripts for various projects such as Malta's construction and industry sectors. These sectors will need significant assistance and monumental effort to be ready for future endeavors, including war if it ever comes to our doorstep."
MLT_begin_navy_reforms: "Towards a Truly Maltese Navy"
MLT_begin_navy_reforms_desc: "With one of the grandest armadas assembled since antiquity, the Ottoman Turks descended upon Malta in droves during the memorable and frightful Great Siege of Malta in 1565. Their fleet consisted of nearly 2 vessels, hosting 40,0 marauders who intended to wipe Malta off the face of the earth. Before European relief arrived and forced the Ottoman Turks into a shattered retreat, Malta held for four months with 6, brave souls. In order to ensure that such an initiative is once again championed by any foe that may make such a similar mistake in invading Malta, another line of defense will need to be established. A Maltese navy will form the basis of this line of defense. This will ensure that no enemy combatant steps foot on our shores. However, whatever limited shipbuilding facilities or dockyards within the Grand Harbor that we possess are inherited from British efforts prior to the Weltkrieg. It is with these facilities that we will lay the groundwork for the establishment of the Maltese navy, with the arming of fishing trawlers."
MLT_modernization_of_da_guns: "Modernize the Garrison's Firepower"
MLT_modernization_of_da_guns_desc: "Since our reform efforts, Maltese garrisons have faced critical weaponry issues. This is largely due to Malta's armories not being well maintained for decades. The garrison is, however, will be updated to match contemporary British standards by obtaining weapons from Jolly old England. We can at least replace outdated weaponry with unused stockpiles from England soon enough. This will allow the Maltese British garrison to have an up-to-date arsenal and stand a better chance of fighting anyone who dares to invade Malta."
MLT_defenive_army: "A Purely Defensive Force"
MLT_defenive_army_desc: "For all of our efforts, there is no desire that a son of Malta will ever be sent off to foreign shores to fight in a conflict on a similar scale to the first Weltkrieg. The priority is established - Malta and its isles are the only redoubts worthy of withstanding a siege for. No Kaiser nor Chairman is worth a thousand of Malta's sons. In preparation for plausible amphibious landings against Malta, bunkers will be built on the shores and doctrines will be prepared and intensely drilled. Coastal patrols will occur daily and both anti-aircraft artillery and coastal battery emplacements will be constructed. With its garrison ready to deal with any attempt to breach Malta, the island will be an impregnable fortress of the Mediterranean."
MLT_army_of_invade: "The Best Defense..."
MLT_army_of_invade_desc: "In spite of our wishes or in our best interest, Malta must now prepare for combat not only within its own realm, but also beyond. However, Malta's sons are not expendable by any means, and as such, we will need to ensure that any operation we undertake is strategic and precise. We must also be aware of our limitations and act accordingly, understanding that our soldiers' lives are of the utmost importance. Our officer corps has already begun learning amphibious war doctrines to avoid bloody waters on foreign shores during any beach assault. In addition, they will have the proper equipment needed to minimize casualties and succeed in their mission. Amphibious warfare is not the only means we can use to gain a upper hand on our enemy, but also vertical envelopment - death from above. Jumping out of an airplane is one of the safest things a man can do, provided he follows proper procedure. The Air Wing has already started several experiments concerning deployment from aircraft, seeing large success with an initial batch of volunteers. With these developments, we can create a force that can do an infinite deal of mischief against our enemies before they even have a chance of repelling us."
MLT_start_air_corp: "The Air Wing Takes Flight"
MLT_start_air_corp_desc: "Since the end of the Weltkrieg, airplanes have proved to be of military value, and not just interesting toys. While it is impractical for Malta to consider aircraft procurement from other nations, our close proximity to air bases in North Africa and the Italian peninsula leaves us defenseless against air raids should conflict occur. Therefore, it is necessary to bolster another line of defense to Malta's sovereignty - an air corps to take to the skies and allow Malta to become an unsinkable aircraft carrier in the middle of the Mediterranean."
MLT_mill_enigies: "A Land of Engineers"
MLT_mill_enigies_desc: "If the military history of Malta shows one thing, it is that the Maltese people have a knack for Engineering. Be it the mighty fortresses which protected our people against sea-bound threats or the transformation of a nature harbor into the mightiest Harbor in the seas, none can doubt our glorious accomplishments. With a second Great War clearing approaching, it is time we capitalize on our engineering spirit. The government has greenlit the creation of a new Maltese Corp of Engineers. This Corp shall be responsible for conducting major military assets, researching the latest projects and assisting civil authorities in repairing damaged infrastructure. By creating an outlet for our famously creative people to flourish, there is no doubt Malta will become the greatest engineering hub in the world."
MLT_radar: "RADAR Projects"
MLT_radar_desc: "RADAR, or radio detection and ranging, is the latest in military tech. While still highly experimental, RADAR allows the tracking and detection of ships or planes in a given area. While Malta is far beyond other nations in this research, it appears that prior to their eviction, the British, took an interest in it. Due to our position in the middle of a highly trafficked sea, there is little doubt that RADAR would be of great use, provided we can crack it's code."
MLT_islandwide_fort: "The Malta Castle Project"
MLT_islandwide_fort_desc: "Atop many hills or overlooking the sea in many places on Malta are mighty castles. Once used by the Knights among others as places of protection and defense, many of these castles have fallen into ruin, or otherwise are useless for defense. However, the existence of these mighty fortresses has led the Corp of Engineers to start their latest project. Dubbed the Castrum Malta Project, the plan envisions a Malta completely and utterly prepared for an attempt at invasion. By building new coastal bunkers, checkpoints in cities and even reporting a few old fortresses, the Corp seeks to create an unbreakable Malta, and even should an invading force land, we shall fight them tooth and nail, going from city to city, island to island, until either they are repelled, or Malta has drained them of the will to fight on."
MLT_modernize_dockyard: "Update and Modernize the Malta Dockyard"
MLT_modernize_dockyard_desc: "Attached to the Grand Harbor, the Malta Dockyard was once one of the largest dockyards for the Royal Navy. A perfect stopping point on their journey to and from the Suez Canal, the Dockyard has seen better days. While the British attempted to maintain it, the Dockyard quickly fell behind in technology. Not wishing to invest the vast funds to modernize it, the British simply left it in the hands of the Maltese Government. A blank cheque has been presented to the officials of the Dockyard, to modernize and update it. No expense shall be spread, for Malta needs the Dockyard, as a fish needs water."
MLT_bigass_guns: "Retooling the Fortress Guns"
MLT_bigass_guns_desc: "On the walls of many of Malta's ancient fortresses are a series of 10-ton guns. Installed to prevent raiding by enemy forces, in this day and age, they are hardly up for the task. However, that is not to say that our progenitors did not have the right idea. To ensure that our people and islands are properly protected, these once mighty guns shall be updated to be able to repeal and attack modern vessels. Nothing is more valuable than our people, thus we must protect them at all costs."
MLT_marine_corp: "Foundations of a Maltese Marine Corp"
MLT_marine_corp_desc: "Almost never in it's history has Malta been able to leave it's own shores. While this has been a blessing, with many in our government wishing to expand our territory, we must be able to truly leave our own shores. Not only this, but we must be able to land on an enemy's shores as well. To this end, the government has greenlit a program to create our own Marine Corp. They shall be Malta's first people to land and make way for the rest of the army. It will no doubt be costly to create such a branch of the military, but if we wish to expand beyond just our home islands, we have no choice but to build one."
MLT_Guardians_of_war_virtue: "Guardians of War Virtue"
MLT_Guardians_of_war_virtue_desc: "Our legacy dates back to 1099, with the Knights Hospitaller founding, and spans nine centuries. Our legacy is long and proud, defending our stronghold against corsairs, Ottoman Turks, and ambitious French Revolutionaries. As such, we can proudly claim to be the Custodians of Military Prowess. Through these reforms, we've effectively done so as the military is ready to take on any obstacle that may present itself. However, we're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it. We will again need to defend our stronghold. We are confident that our legacy and Military Prowess will be an invaluable asset in the fight. It is with pride that we face any challenges that may arise to face us, as the legacy of the previous Hospitallers and Knights of Malta embodies the spirit of the brave soldiers who defended Malta in the past and will once again reinvigorate themselves to man the walls as they did in yore."

MLT_build_up_eco: "Building up the Maltese Economy"
MLT_build_up_eco_desc: "While Malta's economy isn't as large as its European counterparts, it remains stable - but stagnant. The past century witnessed Malta's economy flourish and prosper due to the Napoleonic Wars as it became a major trading hub within the Mediterranean. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 also greatly benefitted Malta with the Mediterranean becoming the "world highway of trade", not to mention that we were already a base of operations for the British Mediterranean Fleet and a coaling station for vessels sailing from beyond the Canal. However, at the dawn of the 20th century, Malta found its former prosperity declining worryingly as ships switched from coal to oil and grew in size. This has led to the rate of port calls in Malta shrinking, as we can no longer accommodate these ships with our facilities. As a result, we must start looking at expanding the economic sector to gradually shift away from our reliance on the port - there have been several suggestions but expanding our maritime facilities, nurturing a tourist economy, and even banking are the most prevalent ones."
MLT_expand_great_harbor: "Expand the Great Harbor"
MLT_expand_great_harbor_desc: "To begin shifting Malta away from its reliance on its ports, it is ironically critical to initiate renovations of the facilities present at our ports. This is so that it can accommodate the tonnage of most maritime vessels present in the Mediterranean - namely cargo ships and oil tankers. This is also the first significant step to allowing us to slowly rebuild our economic prosperity. We have also acquired private investors from surrounding nations to finance these efforts. This has allowed us to begin the process of constructing upgraded jetties and docks to further enhance the efficiency of our ports, enabling them to receive larger vessels. Surrounding businesses in these areas have likewise been renovated to attract sailors during port calls. Hopefully, this investment will yield long-term benefits for our ports and the local economy."
MLT_modernized_med_pitstop: "A Modernized Pitstop in the Heart of the Mediterranean"
MLT_modernized_med_pitstop_desc: "The second step in our initiative in restoring Malta to its former prosperity as a crossroads between Europe, Africa, and the Levant is by greatly expanding our maritime facilities. The fueling stations in Malta will be renovated and expanded in order to accommodate most sea traffic passing by. We also plan to add new ports and harbors to further accommodate larger ships from all over the world. This will allow us to increase trade and tourism, further increasing our prosperity. Finally, we plan to finish modernize our existing ports and harbors to ensure efficient operations, along with a dry dock to also allow for maintenance operations and ship repairs. All these plans will be funded by both the government and private investors, with the goal of creating a modern and efficient port infrastructure. This will ensure that we can keep up with the demands of modern shipping and provide a safe harbor for all vessels that come through our waters."
MLT_expand_aquacultural_productaion: "Fund Aquaculture Expansion"
MLT_expand_aquacultural_productaion_desc: "The state of the agricultural sector in Malta has never been stable - our islands first inhabitants having degraded the soil quality to the point of Malta becoming inhabitable. As a result, we have had to rely on importing most of our foodstuffs for most of our history. In order to preserve some self-determination, we are looking into expanding our aquaculture sector to expand our fishing industry. The Mediterranean hosts a massive variety of wealth of natural creations of which we can surely increase our catch from - especially the Atlantic Bluefin tuna. We are hoping to increase our catch of this species through the construction of additional fisheries and subsidies to fishermen in order to provide more sustainable food sources for our people. Additionally, we will be able to export the fish to other countries, providing economic benefits to our country."
MLT_increase_supply_runs: "Increase Supplyline Runs"
MLT_increase_supply_runs_desc: "Even though our aquaculture expansion has had some limited success, it is not sufficient to stabilize Malta's food security long-term. As a result, we must take advantage of our close proximity to shipping lanes and increase our imports of grains and foodstuffs from foreign nations. This will limit the strain placed on local farmers for the time being. We must also develop long-term strategies to increase our agricultural production capacity to some extent and secure our food supply for the future, as conflict looms on the horizon. To stockpile wheat and other grains, we will contact nations such as France, Italy, and Ukraine to determine whether agreements can be reached to aid us in our precarious situation. In order to support this initiative, the government will fund the construction and purchase of several cargo vessels. This will ensure that our food supply routes remain secure, and that no one in Malta remains hungry."
MLT_encourge_investments: "Encourage Civilian Investment"
MLT_encourge_investments_desc: "While we may have done much to encourage a more diverse economy, there is only so much we can do. If we truly wish for the Maltese economy to flourish, we must get the population to also open up their pockets. Be it offering tax breaks for new businesses or by trying to get people to simply buy local, we must do everything we can to get the money flowing."
MLT_centeral_bank: "Creation of the Central Bank of Malta"
MLT_centeral_bank_desc: "Much to even the shock of our own government, our people have begun massively investing money into our local economy! However, it has gotten to the point that more people are starting businesses than there are investors to actually invest. To solve this, and to ensure a certain level of stability in our economy, the government has decided to birth a Central Bank. While it will take time to fully establish, the Central Bank, in time, will lead to an unprecedented amount of prosperity for our people."
MLT_service_to_sailors: "Services for Sailors"
MLT_service_to_sailors_desc: "Among the varying services in Malta, most are already geared for the sailors, who make up the majority of those who land on our fair shores. As we go about attempting to grow our economy, we cannot forgot those who make up the backbone of our economy. Thus, we must doubleback and ensure that our sailors have  what they want. Be it pubs, food or even desires of the flesh, we must ensure that the sailors are satisfied, no matter the cost."
MLT_deverisy_harbor: "Diversify the Harbor"
MLT_deverisy_harbor_desc: "The Grand Harbor, in recent years especially, has fallen behind in many ways. While it once survived almost all who would land in Malta, under the Reich, this has changed greatly. The Harbor had been made almost exclusively a stop for military vessels. This cannot remain the case. The Harbor shall be made an open space, for all, no matter where they come from. While such a policy may be hard to enforce in wartime, in peacetime it shall no doubt help us fill our coffers."
MLT_foundations_of_tech_industry: "A Foundation for a Tech Industry"
MLT_foundations_of_tech_industry_desc: "While modern technologies, such as the computer, are still in their infancy, they are rapidly growing in popularity. Even despite this, very few nations are able to produce or practice such technologies, due to the exotic resources needed to build them. With Malta being on the crossroads of two oceans, we are in a perfect position in produce these devices. Thus, the government has greenlit a program to stockpile these more rare resources. Even if it takes decades for these technologies to become popular with the masses, Malta shall be prepared to build them and distribute them to all who want them. "
MLT_geared_towards_tourists: "An Economy Geared for Tourism"
MLT_geared_towards_tourists_desc: "If Malta is not lacking for one thing, it is natural beauty. Malta is one of the most pretty places on God's Green Earth, and many people have begun to see this. Already, tourism has exploded as we seek to diversify our economy. Thus, to further encourage this, we shall do all we can to gear our economy for tourism. By encouraging our people to open small shops and by repairing and expanding various spots that tourists flock too, we can ensure that our economy is better than ever before."
MLT_A_Model_British_Economy: "The Salvation of the Maltese Economy"
MLT_A_Model_British_Economy_desc: "After a long and hard fought battle, we have done it. Malta's economy, long stagnating after an over reliance on the Grand Harbor, has been saved. Malta is now home to a budding tech industry, and our cities bustle with tourists and investment activity. We are no longer reliant on simply the Harbor, at long last. While it still forms a massive and vital aspect of our economy, Malta is now and forever free from the shackles of a single economic entity. Virtute et Constantia!"
