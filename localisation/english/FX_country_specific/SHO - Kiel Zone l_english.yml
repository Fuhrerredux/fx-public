#### IDEAS ####

SHO_hamburg_legacy: "Spectre of the Hamburg Commune"
SHO_hamburg_legacy_desc: "The short-lived Collectivist revolt in Hamburg during 1927 was barely put down by the occupying Danish forces. The legacy of the Hamburg Commune lives on, 9 years later. Many socialist organizations still exist, awaiting a moment to rise up against their Danish oppressors once more."
SHO_nazbol_gang: "National Collectivism"
SHO_nazbol_gang_desc: "Hamburg has become the birthplace of the doctrine of National Collectivism. Encompassing a variation of Radical Nationalist and Collectivist ideals, the National Collectivists will likely be the ones to light the fires of revolution to overthrow the Danish Occupiers."
SHO_political_repression: "Political Repression"
SHO_political_repression_desc: "Despite that Democratic movements have achieved Democracy in Denmark itself, the Kiel Zone has remained under a Transitional Government for aproxmiately 6 years now. Many rights still have not been restored, and the Danish Transitional Government actively attempts to dismantle all Collectivist organziations before further reform."
SHO_integrating_denmark: "Integrating territories"
SHO_industrial_burdens: "Industrial Burdens"

SHO_join_soviets: "Apply to join the Third Internationale"

SHO_invade_denmark: "Avenge 1927"
SHO_invade_denmark_desc: "The year of 1927 saw the workers of Hamburg proclaim the First Hamburg Commune, only to be crushed by the Danish oppressors. We will exact our revenge against the Danes."
SHO_invade_germany: "Invade Germany"
#SHO_invade_germany_desc: ""
SHO_puppet_denmark: "Establish a Danish puppet-state"
SHO_puppet_denmark_desc: "By creating a self-administering zone in Denmark and 'borrowing' their industrial machinery and funding, we'll be able to assist our industrial ambitions and lessen the burden on our administrative sector."
SHO_Peace_With_Honour: "Peace with Honour"
SHO_Peace_With_Honour_desc: "We've established occupation of the Jutland penisula, it's time to negotiate for our independence."
SHO_Peace_and_Vengeance: "Peace and Vengeance"
SHO_Peace_and_Vengeance_desc: "We've established occupation of the Jutland penisula, it's time to assert the superiority of the Hamburg Commune over the Danish oppressors!"

SHO_splash_title: "A State In Dismay"
SHO_splash_desc: "The Kiel Zone was created to assist in the complete dismantling of Germany as a nation. However, to this day, it has only ever known a fragile existence due to its tenuous position in Europe. It feels as if every day the country is on the brink of collapsing to one radical group or another. Luckily, the Danish garrison has been able to quell most treasonous activity so far, but their capabilities can only be stretched so thin. Thus, they have allowed the so-called Polaris Freikorps to linger, which mainly consists of exiled Iron Korps members from their time in the Baltics.\n\nDespite the presence of both the Danish guard and the Freikorps, the populace refuses to give in to anything but a full revolution. No matter! Violence has always fixed political tension.\n\nThis is not the only problem Kiel faces, as constant demands for annexation have come from that cursed "Valkist" state in our south. Meanwhile, in our North, the Danes treat us like puppets on strings. If something is to end the idea of a neutral Kiel Zone, it'll cost them an arm and a leg!"
SHO_splash_option: "This can't get worse. Right?"
