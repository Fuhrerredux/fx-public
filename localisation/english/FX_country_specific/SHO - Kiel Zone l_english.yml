SHO_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Of all the regions to be forcibly seized from the Reich, few embody the pettiness and cruelty of such terms as well as the Kiel Zone. Born out of the chaos at the end of the Great War, the mandate has lived a rather unceremonious and unloved life.\n\nWith the rise of the new Germany and the growing weariness of the occupiers, the old mandate may very well receive a new lease on life. This however will not be from the occupiers, nor from Berlin but rather from both the immigrants and natives of Schleswig-Holstein, for whom revolution seems all but assured."

#### IDEAS ####
SHO_anglo_danish_reliance: "Anglo-Danish Reliance"
SHO_anglo_danish_reliance_desc: "The Kiel Zone relays on the support of the Danish and British authorities to protect them from immediate German agression. While the majority would like to reunite with Germany, many enemies of Dresslers regime want to prevent Dressler gaining power in Kiel. The Free city movement desperately wants International recognition while others even proposed to set up a national government in exile in Kiel. Furthermore, Kiel is economically reliant on western imports, something that burdens all of these political movements."
SHO_nazbol_gang: "The Birthplace of National Collectivism"
SHO_nazbol_gang_desc: "Schleswig Holstein since the end of the Great War has been a place of turmoil rebellion and uprisings, either from collectivist workers in the harbors of the city or disenfranchised farmers on the countryside. Schleswig Holstein became the birthplace of a unique form of collectivism, that in light of entente occupation, reparations and inability of the Weimar government also favors a radical nationalism. National Collectivism will likely play a big role in the future of the Kiel Zone."
SHO_nazboler_gang: "The Vanguard of National Collectivism"
SHO_nazboler_gang_desc: "From humble beginnings, the National-Collectivist movement has come far. Once derided as a feeble group of insolent extremists and washed-up conmen, we have finally proven that nationalism and collectivism can not only co-exist, but must be wielded together. Now, it is our duty to not just uphold the German people, but to advance their interests and fufill our destiny by the overthrow of reactionaries and internationalists alike."
SHO_Unstable_occupation: "Unstable Occupation"
SHO_Unstable_occupation_desc: "Despite many treaties and promises, the Kiel Zone has remained a occupied zone under a militaristic commission, much to the dismay of the its population. First the Entente occupied the Kiel canal after the Great War as part of reparation. This was meant to be only a temporary measure, but when Dressler rose to power and it seemed like a civil war was imminent, the British created the Mandate of Kiel ruled by a commission, to protect their interests in the north and isolate Germany. This widely unpopular move was the opposite of what people hoped and now that the Mandate is running out and people are growing ever more restless, the Occupation government needs to find a solution."

### Intro Screen
SHO_splash_title: "A State In Dismay"
SHO_splash_desc: "The Kiel Zone was created to assist in the complete dismantling of Germany as a nation. However, to this day, it has only ever known a fragile existence due to its tenuous position in Europe. It feels as if every day the country is on the brink of collapsing to one radical group or another. Luckily, the Danish garrison has been able to quell most treasonous activity so far, but their capabilities can only be stretched so thin. Thus, they have allowed the so-called Polaris Freikorps to linger, which mainly consists of exiled Iron Korps members from their time in the Baltics.\n\nDespite the presence of both the Danish guard and the Freikorps, the populace refuses to give in to anything but a full revolution. No matter! Violence has always fixed political tension.\n\nThis is not the only problem Kiel faces, as constant demands for annexation have come from that cursed "Valkist" state in our south. Meanwhile, in our North, the Danes treat us like puppets on strings. If something is to end the idea of a neutral Kiel Zone, it'll cost them an arm and a leg!"

### Events
kiel.1.t: "The Arrival of Fritz Wolffheim"
kiel.1.d: "As another year dawns upon the dependent mandate, extremists on both the left and right become further bolstered and emboldened. Out of this menagerie of anti-liberal forces, one group stands out the most amongst the others. Aggregating in the tentatively illegal National-Kollektivistische Partei Deutschland, the National-Collectivists espouse a nationalist, revolutionary ideology that directs intense hatred and anger towards the mandate government. Most disturbingly, recent reports have now indicated that one of their leaders, Fritz Wolffheim has arrived in Kiel.\n\nA former member of the SPD, Wolffheim became well-known for his radical positions amongst the Hamburg left, most especially for his partnership with Heinrich Laufenberg on what has been termed ‘national-bolshevism’. Virulently anti-parliamentarian and staunchly opposed to what he views as reformism, Wolffheim called for the expulsion of the Entente forces at the end of the war through a "revolutionary truce" with bourgeois forces, mustering the German proletariat against "Anglo-American finance capital" that was represented through the humiliation of Germany in the Great War. Once one of the preeminent leaders of the Hamburg left, Wolffheim’s political isolation soon forced him into irrelevance. During this time, Wolffheim began to associate himself more and more with Valkism, especially so with Valkist leader Karl Otto Paetel who he shared certain ideological similarities with. Nevertheless, Wolffheim was shunned by the Valkist movement, due to his Jewish heritage and his firm belief in communism.\n\nWith the atmosphere in Germany becoming ever more oppressive towards socialism of all stripes, Wolffheim fled, returning to the Kiel mandate where his old ally Laufenberg remained. Having corresponded and cooperated with Laufenberg on their ideological principles, the duo have now begun to more actively promote what they term as ‘National-Collectivism’. With the mandate continuing to chafe under Anglo-Danish dominion, many are beginning to turn towards the national-collectivists as they wonder when the occupation will end."
kiel.1.a: "Are we sure this isn’t a plot by Berlin?"

kiel.2.t: "The Kiel Uprising"
kiel.2.d: "Following weeks of continous escalation, tensions in Kiel have come to a boiling point. Now the violence is seemingly escalating every hour, with stores being looted and various groups fighting each other in the streets. Worst of all, government buildings have been stormed by insurrectionists and the leadership of the City is largely out of options. It is unclear who incited this revolt, though many suspect far left militants and opportunists to be behind the chaos. The radical right on the other hand has used the general chaos for their own insurrections and has heavily criticised the police force and current leadership for the chaos. It seems increasingly clear that anarchy is taking over in Kiel."
kiel.2.a: "Where is Copenhagen?"

kiel.3.t: "The Brave Soldiers"
kiel.3.d: "Today, Danish soldiers have arrived at the outskirts of Kiel to support the local forces in their endeavours. The great show of force by the British and Danish is met with mixed reaction from the population, but it is tolerated after it became increasingly clear that the situation the current government finds itself in quickly grew out of hand."
kiel.3.a: "Hooray?"

kiel.4.t: "The End of Bloody Kiel"
kiel.4.d: "With the arrival of additional boots on the ground, the insurrections and uprisings have largely died down for now and order is returning to the area. Some groups have fled into the hinterlands to continue their terrorist actions but it looks like the city itself is quiet. Now is the time to draw a conclusion from this incident and finally change something in this dysfunctional system."
kiel.4.a: "Phew?"

kiel.5.t: "An Uncertain Fate" 
kiel.5.d: "Since the mandate is running out and unrest is still high, the current situation is untenable. Many within the British and Danish government already portray the occupation of Kiel as an unnecessary and costly endeavour. It seems like things are about to change for better or for worse."
kiel.5.a: "We shall see..."
kiel_danish_fate_tt: "§gDue to the recent§! §oeconomic catastrophe§! §gthat has hit§! §rBritain§!, §1Denmark§! §gwill decide what the mandate’s future will turn out to be.§!"

kiel.6.t: "The Mandate’s Future"
kiel.6.d: "With London in the throes of economic collapse, our grip on the Kiel mandate has become totally untenable. As such, it now remains for us to decide how we will take our next step in regards to our German neighbors. One suggestion is that the mandate be dissolved and we withdraw from the mandate entirely. Not only would it allay German fears of continued foreign domination, but it would be a far simpler process for us as we would not have to defend against a potential German invasion.\n\nHowever, some hawks have argued against such a stance. After all, Germany is no doubt preparing herself to reclaim what she views as her rightful place in the world, how can we trust that a second Great War will not break out? Still, it is unlikely that we would be able to resist a full-on invasion by Germany, so perhaps angering them would be an unwise move?"
kiel.6.a: "Surely Berlin is not so stupid to start another war?"
kiel.6.b: "Dressler and his goons cannot be trusted!"

kiel.7.t: "The Ballots of Destiny"
kiel.7.d: "Today the vote that determines the future of the Kiel Mandate has concluded. After a tense period of uncertainty and vicious campaigning by the different factions, the fate of Kiel has been set. While many will certainly be unsatisfied by the results, it looks like the ballots are counted and the results are clear."
kiel.7.a: "Kiel is a free city, now and forever!"
kiel.7.b: "Germany is our homeland!"
kiel.7.b: "Maybe a duchy is in order?"

kiel.8.t: "It Can’t Be!"
kiel.8.d: "When the ballots were counted and all was said and done, the results were a shock to all involved. To the horror of those in Kiel, it appears that the people desired a return to Dressler’s Germany.\n\nBut why? How? Was it a rigged plot by valkist infiltrators? Where were those who opposed the valkists? There is little doubt that Germany will exact a harsh vengeance upon nearly all the political factions within Kiel, not to mention that a return to Germany could draw in Britain or maybe even the Entente!\n\nThe outcome of the referendum has already been denounced by the left, with the communists and social democrats decrying the results as rigged and calling for the people to resist any German attempt to take over Kiel. With the government having lost most of their legitimacy, there is only one course of action that can be taken without sparking war..."
kiel.8.a: "Get London...and Copenhagen on the phone at once!"
kiel_valkism_tt: "§5Because Germany is a revanchist, totalitarian expansionist power that wants to dominate all of Europe and destroy the current world order, we can expect that§! §rBritain§! §5and§! §1Denmark§! §5to intervene swiftly.§!"

kiel.9.t: "The Anti-Valkist Front"
kiel.9.d: "When both London and Copenhagen came out against any unification of Germany and Kiel, Berlin was forced to back down. However, this has only left Kiel now more isolated than ever before with neither Britain nor Denmark wanting to return to an unruly populace that celebrated their withdrawal.\n\nAlthough Kiel’s existence may not be in question for now, the government’s rule most certainly was. Bolstered by fears of German aggression and the continued division on the right between those against and for Valkism, an anti-valkist front has formed between the social democrats and the communists. With their windfall in popularity following their resistance against annexation into Germany, the united front has taken over the Landtag, now holding the reins of power.\n\nKiel has once again fallen to revolution."

kiel.10.d: "Socialists have taken the Landtag. However, in true socialist fashion, there is a split in regards to the fate of the new socialist state. The Sozialdemokratische Partei wishes for a social democratic republic like had existed in Germany before the Valkist takeover, while the coalition of radical parties spearheaded by the Kollektivistische Arbeiterpartei propose a full-on Bolshevik state in solidarity with our Soviet brothers to further the wider world revolution. It is up to the upcoming congress to decide which direction the workers shall go."

kiel.11.t: "The Free City"
kiel.11.d: "While the left wing is bickering among themselves and the far right wishes to sell out Kiel to Dressler, many exiles of the upper class and Kiel industrialists have formed their own voting block. Together with many former members of Schleicher's cabinet, they not only have the funds but also the connections to establish a strong state opposed to Dressler. Now that the Free City is established, the nationalists need to find allies to form a governing majority. The localist conservatives and farmer unions were approached, their support all but guaranteeing the Nationalist's hold on power. However, they are reluctant to empower these scions of the fallen Weimar Republic, who failed to save their old nation from catastrophe."

kiel.11.b: "What do they know about Schleswig?"

kiel.12.t: "The City's Government"
kiel.12.d: "After the new state has been secured, we will now have to decide on the nature of our government. Some argue we should continue Schleicher’s state of emergency and rule by decree, citing the ideas of the "New State" by Papen. This however would entail an authoritarian Republic, which others see as authoritarianism that is similar to Valkism and a betrayal of the trust of the people and their political values. Nobody however can deny that Kiel is in a situation where parliamentary gridlock and large debates are a luxury that cannot be allowed."
kiel.12.a: "A firm hand is needed"
kiel.12.b: "We will not sink ourselves to Dressler’s level!"

kiel.13.t: "The Agrarian Triumph"
kiel.13.d: "Dissatisfied with the neglect they faced at the hands of the urban dominated government, the farmers of Schleswig-Holstein have stormed the Landtag and have forced the "städter" government to resign. Now, as the farmers gather around victorious in the landtag, their provisional government led by an unsteady united front of the moderate Landespartei and radical Landvolk draw up plans. The province turned country wonders what the future will bring."

kiel.14.b: "We don’t live in 1871 for god’s sake!"

kiel.15.t: "The Plight of the People"
kiel.15.d: "The rural class is strong in Kiel, making up a good chunk of the population. However, the temporary nature of the mandate and the recent economic crisis has only served to sink the farmers further into poverty with the undeniable side effect of their widespread discontentment with the current government.\n\nFor many, the party to channel their discontentment towards is the traditionalist Landespartei, a social conservative localist party that follows rural interests and an isolationist policy. Made up of conservative exiles and aristocrats from Germany, their primary demographic are farmers and landowners who eschew both the left and the radical nationalist right. Unfortunately for them, their continued inability to influence policy in favor of the rural class has caused many to grow disillusioned with what many perceive as a decrepit, reactionary party.\n\nAs such, many farmers have now fled to the Rural People's Movement, known more colloquially as the Landvolk. This movement is a far right nationalist movement, once being the preeminent political force in Schleswig-Holstein before the rise of Valkism. The Landvolk movement is viciously anti western, possesses a radical reactionary nature and is largely influenced by Völkish beliefs of blood and soil nationalism.\n\nWhile the Landespartei is definitely the mainstream agrarian party, the Landvolk in recent years have regained influence and both parties already cooperate on a number of issues. As Kiel continues to be rocked by the threat of revolution and annexation, a split has formed amongst the rural class. Although their size, existing influence and connections may benefit them well, many predict that the comparatively moderate Landespartei is likely to fall from grace soon as farmers continue to grow ever more discontented, more so when the Landvolk’s populist and revolutionary rhetoric continue to draw in more and more people."

The united leftist movement has thus called for an extraordinary Congress to form a proper socialist government in Kiel which is ready for the troubles the young state now has to face. In spite of initial peace,various factions soon formed, dividing the congress and nearly causing a deadlock. The three largest are the Collectivists led by Wilhelm Pieck, the National Collectivists under Heinrich Laufenberg and the Libertarian Socialists led by Heinrich Brandler. After long debates, countless compromises and even a brawl at the front entrance, the new leadership can finally be announced. For the liberation of the people from Valkism, the congress has decided that..."

kiel.18.d: "The fledgling government in Kiel has proposed to work together with us against the expansionism of the Reich. They think we could reach a fruitful business- and defensive deal. Many in our government however have pointed out the territorial disputes we still have as well as the questionable unprofessional nature of their government and advised us to stay neutral in this matter. It is up to us now to decide how we will deal with our young southern neighbours."

kiel.19.d: "The Government of Kiel, has announced the return of fees on all foreign ships entering the Kiel canal. The Canal fees stopped in the 1920s to boost the economy of the Baltic states. Shipping companies are already demanding that we provide them some sort of assistance in the face of this drastic change."
kiel.19.a: "Damned parasites!"

kiel.20.t: "The Kiel Canal Flooded"
kiel.20.d: "Today in an unexpected turn of events, the Kiel Canal was destroyed by a sabotage squad of the Kiel home defence force. In their struggle against Germany, the military decided to deny Germany and especially the German fleet this important piece of infrastructure, rendering it useless to commercial and military vessels. The destruction of the Canal also flooded the surrounding lowlands, creating a huge area of marshland which will hinder any rapid advance. These measures prove the desperate nature of the fight that the Kiel army is fighting and we will likely see more acts of sabotage and guerilla warfare while German troops advance day by day."
kiel.20.a: "Germany devolves further."

kiel.21.t: "A Request from Kiel"
kiel.21.d: "We have received envoys from Kiel offering their support for our alliance. They cite our common enemies and would allow our man to be stationed in their nation. Yet it would be another nation we would need to protect and they would surely expect us to support their small armed forces. We need to decide if it is worth the expenses."
kiel.21.a: "Come on in!"
kiel.21.b: "What do we need these farmers for?"

kiel.22.t: "Collapse of the New Kieler Bank"
kiel.22.d: "After the recent collapse in London, the New Kieler bank, which mostly replaced the Reichsbank after the establishment of the Kiel zone and the most important bank in the entirity of Schleswig Holstein has also collapsed destroying our economy with it."
kiel.22.a: "We must prepare for the worst!"

kiel.23.t: "The Schleswig Soviet"
kiel.23.d: "Worrying news reached us today from Kiel. It looks like the Schleswig experiment has truly failed. After the failure of the referendum, radical left wing groups stormed the city hall and occupied vital infrastructure. With the support of the population and the local social democrats, the armed forces and our remaining troops decided not to escalate the violence further. Although the silver lining is that Kiel is still aligned against Germany, these developments have proved embarrassing for our administration."

kiel.25.t: "Socialist Uprising in the North!"
kiel.25.d: "Traitorous elements today have rebelled against our police forces, plunging many cities in the north of the Reich into chaos. These terrorists must be dealt with swiftly. We will order our army and police to shoot on sight, the socialist rot has festered for a long time during the old system, it is time we finally cut them out. The incompetent leadership of the local police force and garrison will face their mistakes as well."
kiel.25.a: "We will defend Germany from Bolshevism!"

kiel.26.t: "Kiel Pleads for Support Against Germany"
kiel.26.d: "Today a delegation from Kiel has arrived. The City is one of the areas harshly contested since the end of the Great War with its status currently unclear. Their recently established independent government is threatened by German revanchism and therefore their delegation states that they are looking for allies with mutual interests especially in the containment of Valkism. While we certainly could use a base that is close to the German ports, the small state of Kiel is very vulnerable and not many nations even recognize them as of right now. Accepting this proposal could be a diplomatic gamble."
kiel.26.a: "Germany must be contained!"
kiel.26.b: "An absurd proposition"

kiel.27.t: "[From.GetName] Sends Support"
kiel.27.d: "[From.GetName] has accepted our calls for aid. After long negotiations, we came to an agreement with [From.GetName] which will provide us with much needed material and equipment for our war effort. We are of course indebted to [From.GetName] but as of right now weapons are the only thing that will keep our nation alive."
kiel.27.a: "Phew!"

kiel.28.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses Support"
kiel.28.d: "[From.GetName] has refused our calls for aid. They stated that they can not spare any equipment for our doomed cause as they called it. Not only would any land lease or other material aid strain their already struggling economy, they also fear that military secrets could fall into the hands of Germany. The [From.GetName] delegation congratulated our bravery but ultimately sent our men back empty handed."
kiel.28.a: "They'll regret it soon"

kiel.29.t: "Kiel Proposes Mutual Defense Treaty"
kiel.29.d: "Today diplomats from Kiel approached our contacts with an offer to form a mutual defensive alliance to curtail any further Valkist aggression. They state that our nations would mutually benefit from such an agreement which could be a basis for future cooperation. While the little statelet surely holds noble goals, they are strategically isolated and our recognition of their status and any agreement could spark a diplomatic crisis with Germany and its allies."
kiel.29.a: "Down with valkism!"
kiel.29.b: "Danes aren't Germans!"

kiel.30.t: "[From.GetName] Accepts"
kiel.30.d: "Today, [From.GetName] has accepted our proposal to a mutual defence treaty. After some days of tense negotiations in secrecy, our nations came to an understanding. [From.GetName] has now formally recognized and signed all papers officializing the treaty. After the public announcement was made in national newspapers, Germany issued an immediate diplomatic protest. Thanks to careful preparations, border conflicts and unrest by local Valkist groups was kept to a minimum."
kiel.30.a: "Berlin will be ours soon"

kiel.31.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses"
kiel.31.d: "Today, [From.GetName] has refused our proposals, while initially sympathetic to our cause, they cited the inherent danger and possibility for further escalation with Germany and its allies as the main reason for their refusal. While this concern is understandable they also continued to argue that our small army and industry would add no inherent value to their cause against Germany. The diplomatic meeting was present as purely informal in nature and the [From.GetName] government explained in a press conference that they would only acknowledge the neutrality of the League of Nations Mandate of Kiel but nothing more."
kiel.31.a: "Their loss"

kiel.32.t: "Revolts Against the Government!"
kiel.32.d: "News has reached us that various insurrections have broken out in major cities of the Reich. The well prepared attacks against our infrastructure and government buildings decapitated the chain of command in these areas and rendered our overwhelmed, surprised police forces helpless. Our intelligence agency suspects foreign instigation behind the uprising and found traces of large scale arms smuggling across our borders. These traitors will need to be dealt with swiftly while we uncover the networks behind all this. Our troops are moving in as we speak.  "
kiel.32.a: "Curse these intransigeants!"

kiel.33.t: "Peace with Kiel?"
kiel.33.d: "Unfortunately, it appears that our war against the Kiel government has not gone according to plan. As their troops continue to make headway into Denmark proper, they have sent a message of peace, requesting that they receive reparations and assurance that they will be secure in a war against Germany from our side of the border."
kiel.33.a: "They did win..."
kiel.33.b: "We will not let some hopped-up Germans dictate ridiculous terms"
kiel.33.c: "Do they think of themselves as killing machines?"

kiel.34.t: "[From.GetName] Demands White Peace"
kiel.34.d: "Our request for a favourable peace has seemingly been rebuffed by [From.GetNameDef], who have instead demanded that we simply accept a white peace. While such a thing is unfortunate, it would be better than attempting to defeat the great power that is [From.GetNameDef] all by ourselves."
kiel.34.a: "Better safe than sorry..."
kiel.34.b: "Pfft, we can take them on!"

kiel.35.t: "The Closure of the Kiel Canal" 
kiel.35.d: "Today the pretender government in the occupied north has announced that it will close the Kiel Canal to international shipping with exemptions only made for forces allied to the city. This action is obviously aimed against us and effectively prevents us from uniting our north sea and Baltic fleets without entering British and Danish waters. Furthermore this decision also hurts our remaining civilian shipping lines who now face a blockade in all but name again. Already harbours in the east of our nation feel the economic fallout and unrest is spreading in those cities. "
kiel.35.a: "These imperial lap dogs will face justice eventually..."

kiel.36.t: "A Military Attaché in Kiel?"
kiel.36.d: "Now that we have formed a proper government and began the recruitment of a proper military, we are faced with a series of difficult decisions and troubles. The Reichswehr is massing troops at our border and it is becoming increasingly clear that our young and inexperienced force will not be able to stand against them. Some within our administration suggested that we look towards the French, who experienced great success with the buildup of the Rhenish Army from a mere militia. It's possible we could mirror this development in Kiel as well. There are however those few professional military men in our ranks who detest the French since the Great War and insist that we do not need their aid at all. It is up to our leadership to decide now. "
kiel.36.a: "We need to further contain the Boche!"
kiel.36.b: "These goons do not deserve our respect!"

kiel.37.t: "The French Military Attaché"
kiel.37.d: "France has accepted our request and sent a small detachment to Kiel. These men were already experienced with rearmament efforts in the Rhineland and will now do their best to aid our efforts. This was met with outrage by conservative elements within our state but that's nothing those Frenchmen did not already grow accustomed to during their time in the Rhineland. Their expertise and contacts will be of great help to our military efforts."
kiel.37.a: "That should keep Berlin in check!"

kiel.38.t: "The Parisian Betrayal"
kiel.38.d: "Snarky remarks of former Reichswehr men could be heard when it was announced in the halls of the Landtag that the French declined our request without much deliberation. It looks like we are on our own when it comes to our military buildup."
kiel.38.a: "What did we expect from these frog-eaters?"

kiel.39.t: "The Socialist Surge"
kiel.39.d: "With the failure of the Second Kiel Uprising, the National-Collectivists have been dealt an extraordinary blow. Unable to capitalize on the opportunity to liberate the German people, radical groups on both the left and right have lost much momentum. This vacuum in popularity however has regrettably only been filled by rival radical parties.\n\nOne party to benefit substantially from this change is the Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei. The former party chairman of the KPD and now-chairman of the SAP, Heinrich Brandler has made a name for himself in Kiel, which has become a hotbed of the revolutionary left. With the rise of the far-right in Germany, the SAP has championed an anti-valkist ‘popular front’ strategy whereby all leftist parties unite to oppose right-wing forces. Such a policy is also steadfastly held by August Thalheimer, another communist veteran who serves as the brain behind the SAP.\n\nIn Thalheimer’s view, the establishment of anti-parliamentary dictatorships akin to what he terms as "Bonapartism" is a move towards valkism, comparing the rise of Dressler to the rise of Napoleon in France during the revolutionary era. As such, a united front of the proletariat against far-right forces, which he views as bourgeois attempts to hold on to power, is the best way for communist forces to take power. Furthermore, he views the "ultra-left" faction of the KPD as responsible for the party’s failure to prevent Dressler’s rise, further dividing him from his old party.\n\nSuch a stance has naturally placed both parties at odds with one another, especially so with the SAP’s distrust of Moscow who sends a great deal of aid and support to the KPD remnants that are represented in the KAP."
kiel.39.a: "Nothing quite like leftist infighting."

kiel.40.t: "Smuggling Operation Discovered"
kiel.40.d: "During a routine inspection by the police around the canal, an unidentified shipment was found containing military supplies. With all weapons and equipment stripped of any discernible markings, it has been difficult to identify their origin. Still, many inside the corps suspect they may originate from the [GER.GetName] to our south. Other suspects include the Danish who may be trying to reinstate their control over Kiel. We can't however make false accusations, and so we will have to choose which nation to confront over this issue."
kiel.40.a: "This is clearly done by the Valkist rabble!"
kiel.40.b: "Bring me the Danish ambassador, he will have to explain this!"

kiel.41.t: "Audience with the German Envoy"
kiel.41.d: "The representative from the Reich has been called to the palace and after a short interrogation has denied all accusations. He warned us however that increasing our border forces could lead to unwanted escalations and advised us to drop the matter."
kiel.41.a: "Who does this lunatic think that he is?"

kiel.42.t: "Audience with the Danish Ambassador"
kiel.42.d: "The Danish ambassador has been called to the palace and even though a short interrogation did not give us the answers that we sought for, the ambassador has promised us that they will tighten their border security to make sure that no weapon shipments or other illegal goods are able to enter our country from their border."
kiel.42.a: "Well alright then."

kiel.43.t: "[SHO.GetName] Seized Hamburg"
kiel.43.d: "While we have been embroiled in our civil war, it seems the lapdogs of Paris and London have not remained idle. With our inability to secure Hamburg and the Hanseatic city being under threat of siege and war, [SHO.GetName] has moved in with the rare joint support of Britain and France, leaving us unable to respond effectively. Nevertheless, they will pay in due time."
kiel.43.a: "Damn them!"

kiel.44.t: "A Spy from Berlin?"
kiel.44.d: "Ever since we have taken power, our government has found itself in a quagmire of accusations by our supposed leftist allies that we are nothing more than ‘social-valkists’, no different from Dressler and his thugs to the south. Whilst this is obviously untrue, we have found difficulty in denying these accusations, especially when Wolffheim’s association with Paetel is widespread knowledge.\n\nHowever, we have run into another problem that is even more pressing. Following our negotiations and ensuing compromise with the misguided valkists of Kiel, it has been alleged by several sources that the minister of state security, Jupp Hoven is a spy for Berlin. Such an accusation has naturally become a massive scandal throughout the communist world, further isolating us from our supposed allies in the liberation of the workers.\n\nNow we face a choice. Should we cut Hoven loose, it will only serve to demonstrate that we are nothing more than pawns of the Bolsheviks, unable to even protect Germans from fantastical lies. However, refusing to let go of Hoven, whose supposed connections with the Abwehr are difficult to disprove would likely deprive us of the aid that we so desperately need if we are to liberate Germany."

kiel.45.d_landespartei: "$kiel.45.d.start$And yet, we withstood it. The fall of the government in Berlin is yet another guarantee that Schleswig-Holstein shall remain free and that the farmers and the peasants will be able to continue living in harmony and freedom.\n\nHowever, things haven’t turned out to be so simple. The loathsome social democrats have now made their return with the end of the war, promising to win the peace that we so graciously and dutifully brought them. With the existential threat to our south neutralized for now, it seems that we face yet another threat in the Landtag itself. Whatever fate ends up having in store for us however, we can rest easy knowing it will be determined by our people."
kiel.45.d_landvolk: "$kiel.45.d.start$In spite of that, we got the last laugh. With Germany now defeated and likely soon divided, Schleswig-Holstein has at last overcome the freedom-haters in Berlin. Once and for all, the farmers of our great state can once more live in peace and freedom without the dictates of any metropolitan tyrants forcing us to comply with their modernist agenda.\n\nUnfortunately, this hasn’t turned out to be the case. With our existence at least ensured for now, the miserable workers, merchants and intellectuals of the cities have come out and demanded that we release our hold on the state. However, although their opposition is not to be taken lightly, we can relax knowing that the people of Schleswig-Holstein are free to decide what comes next."

Whilst the presidency is presumably the highest office in the republic, the actual power of the president is not ample to say the least. Hence, the parties have opted to support those who have proven to be popular, whether it be for their widespread appeal or their past actions.

We have carved out a state ruled by the volk, resistant to the machinations of the internationalist cabal that seeks to impose liberal nonsense onto our people, failing that to brutalize and exploit us.\n\nHowever, we have now run into a certain problem. Whilst we may have railed against politicians and their devious parliamentary tricks in the past, the removal of Germany as one of the great powers has caused the movement to moderate far quicker than we had originally hoped. Moderates both within and outside the movement have called for the government to finally call elections and uphold the will of the people it claims to represent and lead.\n\nNeedless to say, this has sparked a severe reaction by the radicals of the movement, who claim that parliamentary democracy is a failed system and would only invite the imperialists of the world to ravage the volk and destroy all semblance of decency and morality. Even so, such fear mongering has already been described as so, and with the horrors of valkism and its offshoots and predecessors in full view, should we really be so quick to dismiss democracy?"

Whilst many predicted that the dissolution of the mandate would usher Schleswig-Holstein back into the Reich, time has proven this untrue.

Now it lies on us to stop them from enslaving the German people, whether through their maliciousness or incompetence. Even if Berlin holds a great material advantage over us, we will not hide.

With the threat from the south now mostly gone and our independence assured, democratic forces outside of the Landespartei have become ever more emboldened in calling for our step-down or at least an end to the state of emergency that we have been in since our rise to power.\n\nSuch calls have now hit fever pitch, with social democrats and liberals working together to force our hand into calling new elections, even if the leadership of the Landespartei have their doubts about democracy. Unable to resist the democratic wave any longer, it seems that democracy has finally returned to Schleswig-Holstein as the fate of the nation is determined at the ballot box once again."
kiel.50.a: "Onwards!"
kiel_democracy_tt: "§5Landtag elections will be held in 1 month and presidential elections will occur the month after.§!"

kiel.51.t: "The Parliamentary Shift"
kiel.51.d: "Our decision to finally call elections have caused a seismic shift in the political landscape, with many expressing surprise that we would allow ourselves to be potentially dethroned by parties not as privy to the interests of Schleswig-Holstein as we are. The victory of the moderates within the movement have resulted in a merger with the rump National Peasant’s League to form a new Rural People’s Party.\n\nThis move has not gone unnoticed, with the merger of two of the main parties on the right having caused a scare amongst the left and their liberal allies. In response to this, the social democrats and left-liberals have formed a new "Democratic Union" in opposition to our government, promising to further democratize Schleswig-Holstein. Perhaps the only upshot of this move has been scaring the radicals within the former movement into the new party, though we can expect them to be as unruly as always."
kiel.51.a: "So be it"

kiel.52.t: "The Green Baron"
kiel.52.d: "Even if we’d like to think that all of Kiel is behind us in fighting the Valkist menace, reality has proven to not be so simple. As always, there are a few stragglers who continue to believe the lies that Berlin spews upon the world, whether it be due to selfish disbelief in our cause or a genuine faith in German “liberation”. Having accumulated in the Greater German Folk League, the main leader of the Pan-Germanists in Kiel is none other than Franz von Baselli.\n\nHailing from a völkisch-sympathetic family, Baselli’s father was already politically-involved, serving as a lawyer and being a part of an anti-semitic organization. Baselli would spend his childhood in Kiel and graduate from high school the same year the Great War broke out. Baselli would serve on the front until the war’s end, following in his father’s footsteps to study law in Kiel and Hamburg. Baselli would join up with several different anti-republican and anti-mandate organizations. Experiencing both the tumult of the mandate and the republic, Baselli would radicalize ever closer to far-right currents, finding common cause in the Valkist movement. Having been involved in the civil service since returning to Pinneberg, Baselli would join the VDF in 1931, soon quickly rising to the position of municipal mayor in the valkist surge following Dressler’s rise to power.\n\nNow, Baselli stands at the head of the pan-Germanists in Schleswig-Holstein, having gained further prominence in spite of the failed Second Kiel Uprising. Whilst his hopes of unification with Germany have been dashed at the recent referendum, there is no doubt that he is prepared to surrender all power to Berlin should he get the chance. Even now, Baselli continues to agitate and call for the troops to give up instead of resisting the imposition of tyranny by Berlin - yet another hurdle that we must jump over in the continued containment of Valkism."
kiel.52.a: "His place is in Germany, preferably behind bars while we're at it."
	  
kiel.53.t: "Gottfried Treviranus Flees Kiel"
kiel.53.d: "As we consolidate ourselves against internal and external enemies alike, reports have recently indicated that Gottfried Treviranus has fled to Britain, being received rather well by the political class in London. Along with him, many of the former German exiles are beginning to leave en masse, heading towards greener pastures in the Rhineland and France.\n\nA nationalist opposed to the Valkist regime and its collaborators, Treviranus fled to Kiel not long after Dressler’s rise, working with former-chancellor Kurt von Schleicher to organize anti-Valkist exiles who opposed the political developments in Berlin. Whilst he may hate the current regime more than us, there is little doubt that he will leverage his prominence to discourage any aid from London coming towards us, though whether it will make a difference remains to be seen."
kiel.53.a: "Yet another one of Schleicher's rats gone"
SHO_no_british_aid_tt: "§5Due to his lobbying, we will be unable to ask for British aid unless the situation becomes truly desperate.§!"
	  
kiel.54.t: "A New Party"
kiel.54.d: "When Dressler rose to power, the idea of a red Germany seemed lost. The bourgeois and capitalist forces united together, ready to support Dressler in his strike against the proletariat. We, the representatives and defenders of the proletariat were attacked from every side, with the party splintering and our leaders fleeing both east and west.\n\nIn this time of tribulation, we lost Ernst Thälmann. The leader of the party since 1925, Thälmann led the party through thick and thin, becoming the party’s candidate in the last presidential election of the doomed Republic. Yet despite all of that, Dressler’s rise also caused Thälmann to simply vanish. Some suspect that he has changed identity, attempting to dodge any responsibility that he holds for the party’s failure to stop the reactionary surge. Others think that Thälmann is dead, and that he died either out of shame or execution by the criminals in Berlin. Either way, many of those who were held in high regard by him have now witnessed their political fortunes rapidly turn around, with both inter-party and external communist forces now holding the reins. Nevertheless, we will always remember the man who first spearheaded the German revolution."
kiel.54.a: "He will not be forgotten."
	  
kiel.55.t: "Rote Kapelle"
kiel.55.d: "As we pivot towards the liberation of the German proletariat, we must be ready to use any and all advantages that we can get our hands on. One such domain that we can punch well above our weight in is intel, where we can leverage the sympathy of more enlightened officers and soldiers to our gain.\n\nHowever, few officers within the Reichswehr are willing to see the light and cooperate with us for German liberation. Thus, most of the few officers that we have successfully converted are opportunists or are highly sympathetic to the National-Bolshevik cause. One of such officers is Harro Schulze-Boysen, a young Luftwaffe officer who we have recently made contact with. Having spent his first political years as a member of the Jungdo, Boysen was initially first blinded by Valkism, becoming a follower of the revolutionary currents of Valkism. In spite of this, Boysen soon realized the nonsensical nature of valkism, soon converting towards communism.\n\nHaving been sent by his father to train as a pilot, Boysen continued to develop an intel network within the Reich, which we can now leverage in our favour. Whilst his political sympathies may leave some questions amongst our more left-wing comrades, we are simply grateful for his aid."
kiel.55.a: "Further proof that our cause is just!"

kiel.56.t: "From Russia with Love"
kiel.56.d: "To say that the Second Kiel Uprising was a great disappointment to many socialist and leftists alike would be an understatement. For many, it was yet another missed opportunity by the German left to liberate the proletariat, long shackled by the Kaiser and then the bourgeois Republic and most recently the reactionary Dresslerites and his backstabbing goons. Throughout this period, it seemed that Russia was the only beacon of socialism, an example for all aspiring revolutionaries across the world.\n\nUnfortunately for us, it seems that Moscow has yet another unpleasant gift to bear. In the aftershock of the Kiel uprising, reports have indicated a new wave of donations and support to the Collectivist-Workers Party, with Russia being the most likely culprit behind this renewed support.\n\nHit hard by the rise of Dressler, the KPD fled into exile, establishing bases from Paris to Moscow. Forced to reevaluate their "ultra-left" course, they have opted to move towards an anti-valkist position, with Walter Ulbricht and Wilhelm Pieck becoming the new chiefs of the communist camp. Despite their greatly weakened position, the KPD in-exile continues to spread polemics against the mandates and the German government, with Ulbricht remaining in exile whilst rumours suggest that Pieck is hiding in Kiel, waiting for an opportunity to spread the revolution to the mandate. Even if the leftists of the mandate are splintered, we cannot be sure they will be for long as a radical upset could potentially create a springboard for the red menace to overtake the mandate..."
kiel.56.a: "Damned Russian tools!"

kiel.57.t: "Rightist Fury"
kiel.57.d: "Whilst they have always been a thorn in our side, the SAP have been growing too big for their boots. Recent actions taken in the interest of the revolution have been recently decried by the rightists of the SAP, with the main theoretician, August Thalheimer taking the opportunity to denounce us for making a "pronounced left error" once again in taking action against the hidden reactionaries in our midst.\n\nWhilst we have already begun to deal with this dissent, it is still an ominous warning to us that we can not trust those who are not on board with us already. As the fated hour of struggle with Berlin draws ever closer, we must be ready to stand united, lest we all fall divided once again."
kiel.57.a: "He should consider actually fighting for the revolution!"

kiel.58.t: "The Red General's Tentacles"
kiel.58.d: "When the exile government took power in Kiel, it was with the implicit understanding of their masters in the Rhineland that they would recognise and subordinate themselves to Kurt von Schleicher should he and his lackeys seize power in Koblenz. This understanding will now be fulfilled, with the rise of Schleicher in the Rhineland leading to our government quickly recognizing the legitimate German government. Even if some complain about Schleicher’s ambitions, there is little doubt that we share the same goal."
kiel.58.a: "The REAL Germany still stands!"

kiel.59.t: "Copenhagen's Price"
kiel.59.d: "In response to our request for a non-aggression pact, Denmark has opted to propose a counter-offer whereby we grant them Flensburg in exchange for their neutrality. Such a trade of territory would both diminish our legitimacy and weaken us immensely, yet some consider whether we should really risk an unwinnable two-front war."

kiel.60.t: "An Expected Response"
kiel.60.d: "As we should have probably expected, the government in Kiel has refused our offer, deeming it totally unacceptable.

SHO_Natpop_republicans_desc: "In times like this it is clear that a strong experienced leadership is needed to prevent Kiel fully slipping into the hands of the British or an immediate Valkist takeover. The remnants of Schleicher's man already proved their worth to the British and they seem ready to support our Regime for their containment policy."

SHO_contact_entente: "Negotiate with the Entente"
SHO_contact_entente_desc: "It is clear that as of now we are at the mercy of the West. Should they move their soldiers in again we are done for. Similarly if they abandon us, it would be impossible to prevent an immediate Valkist takeover. We need to negotiate our status with the west as soon as possible and show that we are a valuable piece in the struggle against Valkism. "

SHO_Deal_with_danes: "Meetings with Copenhagen"
SHO_Deal_with_danes_desc: "The relationship with the Danish is tense to say the least, however we all know that the Danish were reluctant at best about our occupation and many outright rejected it. This is a basis we can work on. Denmark would be a valuable partner for supply and trade and they surely would support a strong state between them and Dressler. "

SHO_return_seized_german_estates: "Return Seized Estates"
SHO_return_seized_german_estates_desc: "Many lands, estates and goods were seized by the occupation forces. We were able to negotiate a full restoration of all estates and lands to their old owners as part of the transformation towards our new civilian government."

SHO_reichswehr: "The Reichswehr Clique"
SHO_reichswehr_desc: "A few men who worked for Schleicher came to Kiel to escape Dressler's wrath. They still have great connections within the German army. With their knowledge, connections and information, they will be a valuable core for a new military"

SHO_free_city_kiel: "The Free City"
SHO_free_city_kiel_desc: "Kiel shall become a Free City under the protection of the League of nations. It will serve as a trade hub and neutral buffer state of the north. Our German culture and Hanseatic Legacy shall be restored and bring new glory. We will be self governed and free from either the tyranny of Dressler or the military occupation of the West. We now only need to fortify our new state."

SHO_welcome_german_exiles: "Welcome German Exiles"
SHO_welcome_german_exiles_desc: "Many poor souls fled the persecutions within Dressler's state, who are we to send our brothers and sisters away. We can use every working hand we can get and in return they shall be provided with housing, food and whatever they need. A lot of these exiles are former soldiers, officials and workers, all professions our young state desperately needs."

SHO_war_eco: "Everything for the War"
SHO_war_eco_desc: "It is only a matter of time until Dressler’s troops will cross our border and try to take our small nation. But we will be ready, prepared for the inevitable. Our men learned in the same academies, trained in the same barracks and fought the same wars. We know their tactics but we will honour our great military traditions. Together with support from the West, Kiel will be a fortress and taking it will cost them dearly"

SHO_crush_communism: "Beat Back Bolshevism"
SHO_crush_communism_desc: "The red menace only weakens our state and allows for disunity and infighting to foster, something we can not accept as of right now. Their continuous socialist rebellions already did enough damage. We have to end this threat now decisively. This way we will also be able to prove our worth to our western allies."

SHO_referendum_lobbing: "Lobby for a Referendum"
SHO_referendum_lobbing_desc: "To fully legitimise our rule, we will push for a public referendum about the future of our new state."

SHO_stirke_deal_democrat_opposition: "Work with the Opposition"
SHO_stirke_deal_democrat_opposition_desc: "We can not allow disunity to weaken our new civil government. Our men are already on their ways to open up negotiations with prominent opposition leaders. A united Front against Valkism and foreign dominance and in favour of local development and prosperity would be ideal for us. We already have some union leaders who agree with us on this vision."

SHO_limited_parliament: "Puppet the Landtag"
SHO_limited_parliament_desc: "It is important that we uphold the democratic tradition and not fall to despotism and tyranny, otherwise we are no better than the Valkists. We have seen the results of Schleicher's ill fated coup. The new parliament however will be severely limited in some aspects to prevent the same problems that plagued the Weimar Republic. For now a strong executive is needed."

SHO_temp_dictator: "A Temporary Dictator"
SHO_temp_dictator_desc: "We can not allow ourselves to fall into the trappings of partisan politics right now. Our nation is at the brink of war. What we now need is decisive leadership, ready to take the needed measures to protect our future. Once the crisis is averted, regular parliamentary sessions should resume. The Landtag today is for a general commissioner with dictatorial powers and it will be the Landtag who will decide when to end this state of emergency again. "

SHO_RHI_contacts: "Contacts in the Rhine"
SHO_RHI_contacts_desc: "We do not stand alone in our struggle against Dressler. Many elements still loyal to the old state, fled to the Rhenish State which recently got recognized as its own entity just like we did. The Rhineland is just as much a target and therefore it is only natural that we should work together with them. We will immediately dispatch some diplomats."

SHO_follow_Fatherland_front: "The Austrian Example"
SHO_follow_Fatherland_front_desc: "The Austrians created a united front of nationalists, conservatives and the army against Valkism and Socialism. This "Austro-corporatism" works under the premise of class cooperation, faith and internal peace to stabilise the nation. It is a good template we can follow."

SHO_corporatist_society: "A Corporatist System"
SHO_corporatist_society_desc: "Corporatism is an economic and social system in which employers and employees are grouped into corporations based on their profession. These corporations then elect representatives which participate in the government. This concept opposes regular party politics and favours central control of the state. Participation in these corporations is of course compulsory. This system was already discussed in young conservative circles and during Schleicher's chancellorship, but now we finally have the opportunity to implement it. At least on a small scale."

SHO_prussian_militarism: "Encourage Militarism"
SHO_prussian_militarism_desc: "It is important that we foster a martial spirit to defend our new state against external and internal threats. Our society should be just as well prepared for the worst cast as our army. Every citizen will be educated, every adult trained and our volunteer army will hold a prestigious place in society. Hopefully this will bring in some new recruits as well."

SHO_create_bismarckbund: "Create the Bismarckbund"
SHO_create_bismarckbund_desc: "The Bismarckbund will be our very own national militia, tasked with supporting security forces, work projects and institutions of the state. Their patron is the founder of Germany and national Hero Bismarck himself. The Bund also serves as security forces against the many Valkist groups and some describe them as "Kiel’s TST", a ridiculous comparison obviously."

SHO_Embrace_naval_trad: "Embrace our Naval Heritage"
SHO_Embrace_naval_trad_desc: "The Sea was always calling in our great city. We have always been traders, seafarers and one of the great harbours of the north. While we were sidelined for city like Hamburg or Lübeck, this is the day Kiel is finally able to write history. We can never neglect our naval heritage in a crucial hour like this. The docks are already working day and night to build the needed fleet for our endeavours -both military and civilian."

SHO_army_with_state: "The Prussian Tradition"
SHO_army_with_state_desc: "Prussia is under the stranglehold of Valkism but the Prussian spirit is not dead. Not only did many of the Heer desert to our state, some of the Junkers and others also sought refuge from the increasing radicalism of the Valkist government. The Prussian discipline, honour and efficiency is very much alive within Kiel"

SHO_official_bund_koingin_louise: "Officialize the Luisebund"
SHO_official_bund_koingin_louise_desc: "The Bund Königin Luise or Luisebund was created soon after the Bismarckbund for the women and girls of our state. With the great success of the former, we should also officialize this Luisebund. Women and Girls will be taught how to do emergency work, basic medical skills, how to lead a household and estate and other necessary skills to support the man at the front and lead a family at home. "

SHO_create_work_program: "Begin Work Programs"
SHO_create_work_program_desc: "To rejuvenate our economy, we should create public work programs. It's clear in Germany that Schleicher's plans worked out well, even though Dressler is now reaping the benefits. Austerity can not be the way forward. Kiel, let's build!"

SHO_promote_seldte: "Promote Seldte"
SHO_promote_seldte_desc: "Seldte is well known within veteran circles, but he early on got sidelined within the valkist movement and his place in the Freikorps and Veterans community was taken over by Dressler. Nonetheless, his organisation skills are exceptional and his followers were instrumental in the formation of our Bismarckbund. We should give Seldte an official position within our government or army. "

SHO_expand_notprogramme: "Expand Emergency Programs"
SHO_expand_notprogramme_desc: "It is clear to everyone that tensions will increase in the foreseeable future. As of now it is necessary that we expand the emergency programs, which are already in place and further expand these measures. New housing programs, soup kitchens, war bonds, loans and security measures will be enacted to keep public order"

SHO_father_modern_germany: "The Father of Modern Germany"
SHO_father_modern_germany_desc: "Gottfried Treviranus and his clique have prevented the worst for our city and kept the spectre of Valkism at bay. Despite the odds, Kiel is prospering and one of the centres in the fight against international Valkism. Our Fortress will be the spark that will light the flame of a reborn Germany. "



SHO_Peoples_revolution: "Victory of the People"
SHO_Peoples_revolution_desc: "The Revolution was finally able to push out the bourgeois powers of old, the Valkist revisionists and the occupation forces of the reaction. Our workers and soldiers fought bravely and their bravery and sacrifice was rewarded. It is now up to us to secure this new state."

SHO_contacts_with_moskau: "Our Soviet Comrades"
SHO_contacts_with_moskau_desc: "We are in a very precarious situation as of now. It would be wise to reach out to fellow socialist powers for their support. The Russians already sent us arms but now that we don't have to rely on smuggling, we can properly rearm as fast as possible before the west gets ideas of a blockade."

SHO_volksheer: "The People's Army"
SHO_volksheer_desc: "We won't allow our army to be a refuge for reactionary powers or outdated hierarchical structures. We have seen how this worked in the Weimar Republic. Instead we should model our new army after the militias of the Red 100 and the Red Front Fighter Unions."

SHO_frauenabteilung: "The Women's Department"
SHO_frauenabteilung_desc: "The first class distinction is that between men and women. The suppression of women is an artificial norm upheld by bourgeois culture. Women used to share the same place in the workforce and the same social status of men in times before agriculture and only with the development of class were relegated to secondary status. Therefore we have to acknowledge this reality and propagate a equal treatment of women and their full involvement in the workforce."

SHO_United_front: "Enforce Unity"
SHO_United_front_desc: "Sectarian struggles have plagued our revolution since its very beginning. We should strive to form a broad and united front against the looming threat of Valkism. The proletariat needs to support each other right now. We will make sure that we work against the forces of dissent and division with the forces of our state and a broad network of informants."

SHO_kiel_fortress: "Fortress Kiel"
SHO_kiel_fortress_desc: "Kiel needs to withstand the storm of the reaction. We will build vast defensive networks so that our beacon of socialism in Germany weathers the storm."

SHO_seize_means_production: "Seize the Means of Production"
SHO_seize_means_production_desc: "Our revolution is far from finished. We finally have the power to begin the restructuring of our state and economy. The factories are already occupied by workers. We will now officialize the new realities and nationalise the industry in the name of the workers. Councils will be created to oversee production. At the same time, the large landholding estates will be broken up and given to communal farming collectives. This is only the beginning of our model state."

SHO_War_econ: "The Revolutionary Reality"
SHO_War_econ_desc: "While we would like to allow for more goods for the working man with our new possibilities, we have to face the current situation and acknowledge the fact that our greatest trial is still awaiting us. We will direct our entire industrial output and surplus to arming the new nation and defending the revolution, otherwise, everything else might be futile."

SHO_support_KDP: "Support our Revolutionary Comrades"
SHO_support_KDP_desc: "The solidarity of the worker transcends nationality and borders. We will help our struggling comrades to the best of our ability wherever they might be. Therefore we will join the Communist International and the global fight against reactionaries. "

SHO_crush_moderates: "Consolidate Communist Rule"
SHO_crush_moderates_desc: "We nationalised the Industry, suppressed divisionist groups and destroyed the bourgeois hold on our nation. It is time that we fortify our revolution through whatever means possible. We will ban remaining unaligned trade unions, associations and merge all left wing parties into a single united front."

SHO_destroy_opposition: "Finish off the Reactionaries"
SHO_destroy_opposition_desc: "While the workers rule supreme and the councils are doing their job effectively, we are plagued by attacks of remaining reactionaries especially in rural areas. We will dispatch anti partisan troops to deal with these troublemakers and make an example of everyone we catch. These are nothing but lowly bandits."

SHO_Danish_deal: "A Deal with Denmark"
SHO_Danish_deal_desc: "The Danish and their backwards system are rightfully afraid of our revolution, however this is a fight for the future and both we and the Danish face a common enemy. For now we will close the border to Denmark and propose a pact of non interference. Whoever wants to leave us for this backwards nation is free to do so, but of course no Danish man living in our nation has to fear repression because of his nationality as long as he supports our rightful cause. While our hopes are not high, we will send our offer to Coppenhagen. "

SHO_politburo: "Create the Politbüro"
SHO_politburo_desc: "The Politbüro will be a central position to direct and coordinate our work council and the efforts of the state. Its members are elected from within the other organs of the state and serve the nation and the workers congress."

SHO_Party_congress: "The First German People's Congress"
SHO_Party_congress_desc: "The German revolution is in full swing. We have triumphed over all odds presented to us and secured our new state. It is now time to end the state of emergency and begin elections for the leadership and direction of our new socialist state. All the councils will come together in a large congress of the proletariat, workers, soldiers and leaders of our revolution for this important day in the Volkshalle of Kiel."



SHO_Pieck: "The Orthodox Choice"
SHO_Pieck_desc: "Wilhelm Pieck, is a well known name in Germany and far beyond. As a founder of the KPD and one of the best connected left wing leaders, it was to be expected that Piecks faction would come out on top. The founder of the Red Aid organisation has good contacts with Russia and was present during the last German presidential elections to support the KPD candidate. Now that the left has seized control over Kiel, he immediately departed from his short exile to take over the leadership of the revolution in Germany. "

SHO_party_primacy: "Consolidate the Party"
SHO_party_primacy_desc: "The exiled KPD is in shambles, infighting and ideological differences destroying any sort of unity. Pieck, the natural second to Ernst Thälmann however saw a chance in the chaos. Pieck’s faction has moved in to purge any dissidents and revisionists to consolidate their hold and unify the party again. Any organisations outside of the party will need to align themselves or disband under Pieck’s rule."

SHO_est_stasi: "The Ministry of State Security"
SHO_est_stasi_desc: "It is necessary that we keep disunity and foreign intelligence at bay. For that we will have to create a powerful political institution tasked with fighting counter evolutionary actions, valkist subversion and most importantly, traitorous activities. The so-called Deutsche Verwaltung des Inneren was created today for this task."

SHO_german_revolution: "Call for a German Revolution"
SHO_german_revolution_desc: "Germany is ripe for revolution, our radio free Germany is listened to all across Dressler’s realm, while the National Komitee Freies Deutschland works together with resistance across our border. It is only a matter of time until a general uprising happens and then we will be ready to lead the vanguard of the revolution for a free and socialist Germany"

SHO_leader_of_commies: "Vanguardist Principles"
SHO_leader_of_commies_desc: "Our party will form a socialist vanguard to prepare the proletariat for the revolution and lead the movement. We will work tirelessly to establish our Vanguardist state in Germany. We are the only major holdout left so we have a duty towards our comrades to fulfil and burn down the Valkist regime. "

SHO_great_purge_desc: "During our times of consolidation, we were not able to get rid of all troublemakers. Furthermore we have seen who was a reliable ally and who was against us. We learned from this experience and will get rid of pigs like Hermann Remmele and Laufenberg."

SHO_work_with_german_military_commies: "Compromise with the Military"
SHO_work_with_german_military_commies_desc: "We will recruit deserters of the Reichswehr into the ranks of the NKFD if they are politically reliable. This will help us to further professionalise our force which as of now mainly consists of remnants of the Roter Frontkämpferbund. The same compromise has to be made with Reichsbanner fighters. If we want to stand a chance then only a vast and well organised worker militia will be enough. We have learned from our issues in the Ruhr uprisings."

SHO_collectivise_economy: "Begin Collectivization"
SHO_collectivise_economy_desc: "We should begin with our collectivisation efforts as soon as possible. As a first measure we will size large estates and divide them among farmers and smallholders. Furthermore we will create compulsory worker collectives, for the farmers the LPG will be founded. key factories will be nationalised as well and put under the leadership of worker councils loyal to our central planning committee. "

SHO_create_planning_comission: "Set Up Planning Commissions"
SHO_create_planning_comission_desc: "Now that we have begun our collectivisation process, it will be necessary that we begin our central planning efforts. A specific commission will be created to organise and oversee our economic efforts as well as draft a first 4 year plan. For now our focus will be on production of goods important to the coming war efforts and rapid industrialisation."

SHO_red_aid: "Reestablish Red Aid"
SHO_red_aid_desc: "The Red aid and its international wing was the largest organisation of the KPD during Weimar times. It was founded by Pieck but with Dressler's coup, the organisation was banned in Germany. We will now reestablish the German section of the Red Aid again in Kiel. The Red Aid will surely have a lot of work in Kiel."

SHO_international_commies: "The International Revolution"
SHO_international_commies_desc: "While we might have secured the Kiel zone for now, it is clear to everyone that it is only a question of time until the Reich overruns our position. We are a lone torch of socialism in a sea of reaction. Therefore we need powerful friends abroad. Our extensive network of exiled KPD members will work tirelessly to create a military alliance and network of guarantees to keep our fortress in Europe alive. "

SHO_anti_valkist_propaganda: "Anti-Valkist Action"
SHO_anti_valkist_propaganda_desc: "Valkism is the worst form of revisionist and reactionary thought, a twisted vision of revolution, nationalism, militarism and oppression. Our entire state will work tirelessly to fight valkist influence wherever it shows its ugly head. We will discredit their lies in our newspapers and radios, we will fight their thugs on the streets and purge their influence in our universities and bureaucracy.  "

SHO_unify_left_parties: "Unite the Left"
SHO_unify_left_parties_desc: "The downfall of the left during the days of Weimar was their infighting and the right wing of the so-called social democrats. These social valkists are now purged and we are ready to facilitate the unification of all left wing parties into a single united front against the Valkist menace."

SHO_work_with_collaborators: "Work with Dissidents"
SHO_work_with_collaborators_desc: "There are many who have already seen the wrong of their ways and it would be foolish to not use their knowledge and influence to our advantage. Deserters, dissidents and many more have fled to Kiel as well. We will of course keep an eye on them but we can use them to our benefit. A series of pseudo political parties, all still loyal to our core principles, will put the west at ease with our rule and allow us to exert influence over groups of people we otherwise could not reach. Therefore a new Zentrum party, a German National Party and a Farmers Party will be created by our central committee."


SHO_Laufenberg: "The National Revolution"
SHO_Laufenberg_desc: "National Collectivism is an ideology unique to the north of Germany. It became benign after the Ruhr crisis and had its strongholds in Hamburg Kiel and Bremen. Their chief ideologues are Heinrich Laufenberg and Fritz Wolffheim. National Collectivism unites socialist principles of class warfare and syndicalist economic thinking with ultranationalist and revanchist ideas, which were influenced by the Rhur crisis and the occupation of entente troops and their engagement against worker uprisings in north germany as well as the seizure of valuable goods."

SHO_Revanchist_ideals: "Revanchist Ideals"
SHO_Revanchist_ideals_desc: "The Treaty of Versailles was a dictate by foreign imperialist powers against the German worker and his fatherland. Not only did these troops rob and plunder our nation, they also shot our fellow companions and occupied Germany like one of their colonies, while the old fat capitalists in Berlin did nothing. They created the monster that is Valkism, but we must never forget that the worker suffered just as much under the French and British boot as they did under the Valkist one."

SHO_German_worker: "Emphasise the German Worker"
SHO_German_worker_desc: "The German worker forms the backbone of Marxism and we shall strive to support him wherever possible. Our national community stands alone after the failures of the post war revolutions and therefore we will first need to implement a strong socialist system here before we can support international ideas. "

SHO_German_rebirth: "The German Phoenix"
SHO_German_rebirth_desc: "Germany will rise from the ashes under our guidance. The National Revolution will unite all banners behind a single course, the greatest task of any man, the fight for freedom and prosperity."

SHO_Workers_councils: "The Workers' Council"
SHO_Workers_councils_desc: "Instead of integrating already existing trade unions we shall create independent economic worker and fighter organisations. This will also be a basis against any form of compromise with parliamentarism and political parties."

SHO_Eastern_diplomacy: "Reach Out to the East"
SHO_Eastern_diplomacy_desc: "It is only natural that the young nations of Germany and eastern Europe unite with each other to defend themselves against the imperial ambitions of the west. We shall send our diplomats to end our political encirclement."

SHO_socialist_volk_community: "The Socialist Volksgemeinschaft"
SHO_socialist_volk_community_desc: "The Volksgemeinschaft is one of the few admirable aspects of Valkism, a communal basis for worker cooperation that transcends mere material gain. We should foster this communal identity to strengthen a socialist culture within our state against individualist bourgeois capitalism."

SHO_appeal_to_middle_class: "Appeal to the Middle Class"
SHO_appeal_to_middle_class_desc: "Many of the middle class fear to be crushed between the uprising of the workers and the reaction of the Junkers, we have to show them that they are part of our great project and can only gain from the destruction of the capitalist societies that shackle them. We will work together with the farmer movements, small business and appeal to their shared sense of nationalism. They will be integrated into their own council with considerable autonomy and self governance."

SHO_Work_with_landvolk: "Work with the Peasants"
SHO_Work_with_landvolk_desc: "The rural peasants are a class similar to the workers in the factories and were increasingly impoverished and forced into the factories. We acknowledge their plight and support them in a worker-peasant alliance. The peasant movement possesses considerable energy and shares countless similar goals to us even if some were misguided by Valkism or National Populism"

SHO_End_Parliamentarianism: "End Parliamentarianism"
SHO_End_Parliamentarianism_desc: "Parliamentarism is an ill-fated way to power and to govern, therefore we do not support holding any elections or creating any party system similar to the Russians, instead we trust in our council system. Any remnants of parliamentarism will be purged from our state."

SHO_Approach_valkists: "A Valkist Compromise?"
SHO_Approach_valkists_desc: "The Valkists, especially their National Revolutionary wing around Paetel, hold many beliefs similar to ours; it might be helpful to establish connections to these circles and appeal to any dissident or radical Valkist. With the support of the Kiel Valkists, diplomacy with Germany will be considerably easier and we can eliminate a major internal threat."

SHO_Create_one_workers_union: "Streamline the Unions"
SHO_Create_one_workers_union_desc: "As of right now, our nation is made up of countless trade unions worker councils and other organisations, we need to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and streamline the entire process, by forcefully uniting and disbanding a majority of these entities."

SHO_Destroy_communist_dissidents: "Enforce Communist Unity"
SHO_Destroy_communist_dissidents_desc: "many decry us as revisionists, traitors or pseudo valkists, but we are simply realistis. The internal disunity of the left was always their downfall and we can not tolerate voices within our own ranks undermining our position. We are forced to move against these troublemakers and purge them from our ranks."

SHO_huntdown_reactionaries: "Remove Reactionaries"
SHO_huntdown_reactionaries_desc: "There are still countless National Populists, unreformed Valkists and Reactionaries in our state, especially the countryside. Their acts of terrorism grow ever bolder. If we don't want a fifth column in our rear we will need to move against them decisively. Our squads will have the order to shoot in sight and clean the countryside from these bandits."



SHO_Brandler: "The Opposition's Comeback"
SHO_Brandler_desc: "The end of the united KPD in Germany and the chaos that unfolded during the KPD’s exile was the moment Brandler and his men had waited for. After the successful revolution in Kiel, he was able to return to Germany against the opposition of the KPD leadership. Brandler’s independent communism has finally won."

SHO_Fight_socdems: "Attack Social Fascists"
SHO_Fight_socdems_desc: "The SPD is one of the reasons why the revolution in Germany failed and Valkism was able to rise. Instead of fighting with their fellow comrades, they worked with monarchists and nationalists against the worker. We can not permit history to repeat itself"

SHO_spartacusbund_legacy: "The Legacy of Spartacus"
SHO_spartacusbund_legacy_desc: "The Spartakus movement was the beginning of the KPD and taught us many important lessons. We will honour their legacy and create a new KPD in their image. The armed struggle against oppression and imperialism can finally commence. "

SHO_Socialist_republic: "A Socialist Republic"
SHO_Socialist_republic_desc: "Our state is free, independent from foreign powers and capitalist oppression. The trade unions are united, we established a broad anti-valkist front and the nation is secured from internal threats. Now we can truly begin building a society for the worker in the spirit of Marx and Engels."

SHO_Victorious_council: "The Primacy of the Councils"
SHO_Victorious_council_desc: "Our goal is the creation of a council republic. We won over the radicals within the KPD and their old leadership. Inspired by the russian system, we can now implement the original vision of German communism."

SHO_Radical_land_reform: "Radical Land Reform"
SHO_Radical_land_reform_desc: "Our first step towards a new state and social order will be the reformation of ownership and land. The Weimar government always shied away from this step, not realising the necessity. The sooner we begin, the better. The recent chaos is a good opportunity for us to start. At the same time, we will purge any remaining nationalists and conservatives that resist our efforts."

SHO_Worker_aid: "Aid for the Workers"
SHO_Worker_aid_desc: "It is necessary that we implement extensive social programs to remedy the most pressing issues. We will create housing for the workers, support their rights at the workplace and provide proper healthcare and schools. Kiel itself is stricken with poverty and homelessness especially for those of the lower classes, as the capital of our revolution this can not go unaddressed."

SHO_Strengthern_councils: "Strengthen Councils"
SHO_Strengthern_councils_desc: "The worker will no longer be exploited by the capitalist class. We will immediately nationalise key industries and empower local worker councils. Furthermore we will expand the responsibilities of these councils and support them as an integral part of our government apparatus."

SHO_Free_socialist_economy: "A Free Socialist Economy"
SHO_Free_socialist_economy_desc: "The councils will not only be tasked with bureaucratic organisation, but also with discussions and advisory on production and consumption. The councils will include both consumers and producers and therefore a participational economy becomes possible. Furthermore, fair loans, autonomy of worker councils and human working situations will support a post-capitalist economic order."

SHO_Finish_revolution: "Finalise our Revolution"
SHO_Finish_revolution_desc: "Kiel was overthrown by a broad front of communists, like we have imagined. We ceased the moment and struck when the time was right and the odds in our favour. Now however, after we took power, much work remains to be done. Thankfully our leadership is united and our movement ready. "

SHO_Fund_socialist_news: "Fund Socialist News"
SHO_Fund_socialist_news_desc: "We will expand our influence in society by finally funding a daily newspaper, called Arbeiterpolitik and the journal Gegen den Strom with our new resources. This will be a competition to all the other less reliable newspapers in circulation. This will considerably expand our propaganda efforts, especially once we distribute the papers in Valkist occupied lands."

SHO_Farmer_aid: "Help for the Farmers"
SHO_Farmer_aid_desc: "As outlined by the Red Farmers International, the farmers are an important part of the communist struggle and have potential to enlarge our movement. Now that we began our land reforms, we will create considerable relief acts and slowly integrate the remaining farmers unions into our structures. Since the farmers are also the main supporters of radical reactionaries, it is important that we do not let them out of sight and instead bind them to our state."

SHO_Fund_rotfrontkampferbund: "Bolster the Red Front"
SHO_Fund_rotfrontkampferbund_desc: "The Red Front is the core of our newly created militia, tasked with upholding public order and defending the state. If we want to reform them into a proper army, we will need to considerably expand their numbers, training and equipment."

SHO_Fight_the_reaction: "Fight Reactionary Thought"
SHO_Fight_the_reaction_desc: "We can not trust in the predictions that once Valkism reigns the worker will rise up, we have seen that this never happened. Instead we need to face the issue head on, as soon as possible. Therefore we can not tolerate any reactionaries within our borders. We need to strike before they do, because they surely have powerful friends who only wait for our downfall."



SHO_Landvolk_victory: "The Farmer's State"
SHO_Landvolk_victory_desc: "Our lands were always closely connected with agriculture and rural life, from the self ruling peasants during the middle ages until today this tradition is unbroken. We will make sure to preserve this character for the future and stand against the forces of modernism and Industry."

SHO_peasents_army: "An Army of Peasants"
SHO_peasents_army_desc: "Our nation is too small for a standing army similar to that of Germany or France. We will instead follow the example of the swiss militia system and implement a decentralised peasant militia with a small elite core. "

SHO_Wehrbauern: "The Wehrbauern"
SHO_Wehrbauern_desc: "We shall settle and train military men into our border regions to act as an informal militia during war times to harass and slow down enemy advancements until reinforcements arrive. They will be tasked with organising local resistance and in return receive taxation freedoms and equipment from the state. "

SHO_folkish_ideals: "The Völkisch State"
SHO_folkish_ideals_desc: "The Völkisch have a vision of a true state rooted in the soil and blood of its people and see the enemies that attack this age-old natural construct from all sides. They have not fallen to the false promises of Valkism or the do-nothing conservatives, therefore they are natural allies and guides for our national resistance."

SHO_resistance_doctrine: "Resistance Doctrine"
SHO_resistance_doctrine_desc: ""

SHO_work_with_freikorps: "Work with the Freikorps"
SHO_work_with_freikorps_desc: "We of course honour the old Imperial Army and our proud fighters of the war.The Freikorps were always natural allies until they were enthralled by Dressler and his path of legalism, for his presidency. Yet some of the more principled fighters stayed and helped our efforts against the occupation. We should make sure to integrate these loyal men into the core of our militia."

SHO_resistance_doctraine: "A Doctrine of Resistance"
SHO_resistance_doctraine_desc: "We might lose the battle or even the war but we will always know where we came from and what natural order we are fighting for. Our ancestors lived through many hardships already and yet we stand here. We will make them proud by never abandoning our roots, our land and our way of life. They can come and try to make us submit but they will only find death."

SHO_Landspartei_victory: "A Nation Rooted to the Land"
SHO_Landspartei_victory_desc: "Our nation is neither a cosmopolitan trade hub like Britain or the US nor a socialist regime like Russia or a Valkist leader cult like Germany, we are intrinsically tied to our land, history and tradition and we will make sure it stays that way."

SHO_farmer_relief_act: "Relieve Farmers"
SHO_farmer_relief_act_desc: "After the occupation, a lot of farmers were brought to near bankruptcy, we will bail out as many as we can and default their debt. It's the last we can do. Furthermore we will offer up cheap loans to anyone who is ready to rebuild his business."

SHO_village_resettlement_program: "Village Resettlement"
SHO_village_resettlement_program_desc: "Since many refugees from Germany proper now crowd our already overcrowded city we should enact initiatives to bring people back to the land. We will offer up cheap housing and parcel out empty farms to anyone willing to work on them. This new influx of people should bring back new life in many of the almost abandoned villages that dot our nation."

SHO_Communal_farming: "Exhort Communal Farming"
SHO_Communal_farming_desc: "It has become clear that the system of large single owned estates has failed. We need to move forward and maximise efficiency and productivity of the land we have and for that we should collectivise our farms to be run and conglomerates. This way we will be able to challenge foreign producers in size and output and eliminate internal competition that is only hurting us." 

SHO_revive_peasents: "Revive the Peasant Class"
SHO_revive_peasents_desc: "Today, many workers see themselves as part of the proletariat and the conservative peasant as an outdated tool of suppression in their class warfare. We instead see what a peasant really is. The backbone of any conservative and traditional nation, embodying the ideal of the self sufficient self made man living in unity with his country, his land and his faith. We will work to propagate this alternative to the proletariat through our own farmers trade unions and political parties. "

SHO_revitalize_countryside: "Revitalise the Countryside"
SHO_revitalize_countryside_desc: "Many people lost their jobs, moved to the city while old estates and villages were abandoned and left behind. This is an unacceptable development and actively hinders our dreams of rural revivalism. We need to build better infrastructure, offer more services and electrify the countryside to stop and preferably even reverse these trends. Proper roads for a start would at least help moving goods and workforces. Kiel is more than its harbours."

SHO_reagrarianism_program: "Bolster the Agrarian Sector"
SHO_reagrarianism_program_desc: "large grants are needed to save the agrarian sector of our nation and we will need them fast. It is after all the farms and the countryside that feed our people and create our only valuable goods. The Weimar times left the sector devastated, but with our new unique position we might be able to turn things around."

SHO_Large_estates: "Create Large Estates"
SHO_Large_estates_desc: "smallholdings and tiny farms are just not economically viable. We are neither socialists nor valkists and therefore we will not split these working estates and give them to some ignorant workers. These large farms are our only good source of revenue and will need to stay profitable."

SHO_peasent_state: "The Peasant State"
SHO_peasent_state_desc: "This land was always the home of hard working farmhands and landholders, until the greed of bankers and speculators plunged us into crisis and flooded our market with cheap foreign goods. Every Pfennig was squeezed out of us and the rest was taken by interest. But not anymore. We will protect our nation and ban these practices. The countryside will be rejuvenated.  "

SHO_liberal_economics: "Protect the Free Market"
SHO_liberal_economics_desc: "The free market is the lifeblood of our German nation. Every hard working man wants to reap the fruits of his labour. It is not the task of the state to feed everyone. Instead all responsible people are ready to work for their livelihood. Neither large business nor socialist delusions should destroy this self regulating machinery."

SHO_shared_machinery: "Collective Machinery"
SHO_shared_machinery_desc: "We farmers need to stick together. If we pool our money we can modernise our estates and productions much more rapidly and support each other against the greedy businessman and their interest trickery. "

SHO_support_petite_bourgeoisie: "Support the Middle Class"
SHO_support_petite_bourgeoisie_desc: "The middle class is the backbone of our state. Artisans, skilled workers, small business and big farmers are what keeps this nation running. We need to make sure that we lessen their burden and support them wherever we can. Furthermore we should create chances for lower classes to rise in social status and living quality to prevent the class struggle that has plagued this region for so long. Our state will allocate great funds and create programs to support the middle class"


SHO_Economy_rejuvenation: "Economic Recovery"
SHO_Economy_rejuvenation_desc: "We shall implement a series of policies aimed at revitalising our economy, fostering sustainable growth, and restoring financial stability in the face of the ever growing unstable political scene in Europe. Through reforms, investments, new policies and law we will lay the groundwork for a resilient and flourishing economic future."

SHO_expand_railways: "New Railway Projects"
SHO_expand_railways_desc: "The railroads are the arteries of any modern nation. What use are our harbours and industrial centres if we can't get goods in and out of them? During recent years, our already old railway infrastructure has suffered a lot. We will need to invest a considerable amount of resources to repair and expand it."

SHO_modernize_rural_areas: "Modernise the Countryside"
SHO_modernize_rural_areas_desc: "The rural hinterlands of Schleswig Holstein are almost a time capsule. While some might regard this as romantic, it actively hinders our development and fosters backwards thinking and practices. We will begin a campaign to not only upgrade the rural infrastructure but also bring modern economic methods, tools and industry into the region."

SHO_tax_canal: "Tax the Channel"
SHO_tax_canal_desc: "The channel might be our biggest source of income, given its importance for the navy and although it lost a considerable amount of its value, we can still garner some profit from it, we should use that"

SHO_Promote_free_trade: "Secure Free Trade"
SHO_Promote_free_trade_desc: "While many would favour a protectionist trade policy, especially the farmers, we can not risk losing our advantageous trading position between the great powers of Europe. If we don't want people to simply leave us dead in the water, we will need to make sure that we offer the best opportunities possible. Sure we might need to make some compromises here and there but that should not stop us."

SHO_expand_maritime_industry: "Expand the Maritime Industry"
SHO_expand_maritime_industry_desc: "The maritime tradition is old in Kiel and we will do good to expand upon it. We will generously fund new dockyard projects and expand the harbours of our towns, to become a truly modern trading hub."

SHO_banking_reform: "Begin the Banking Reform"
SHO_banking_reform_desc: "The banking system is completely in the gutters and as of right now we are dominated by foreign banks and investors. We need to begin setting up a central banking system if we want to succeed as an economic trade hub in northern Europe."

SHO_planned_eco: "Turn to a Planned Economy"
SHO_planned_eco_desc: "In our current situation we will have to make do with the limited resources at hand. We can not risk gambling these on private businesses. Instead we will task a central planning commission with the creation of an economic plan for the foreseeable future."

SHO_recive_loans: "Hand out Cheap Loans"
SHO_recive_loans_desc: "To further enhance the prospects of local business and companies we will begin handing out cheap government loans. This will hopefully increase our economic growth and limit the influence of foreign investors."

SHO_Militarization_of_economy: "Prepare our Economy for War"
SHO_Militarization_of_economy_desc: "It is an open secret that Germany will strike against us as soon as possible. We will need to be prepared. Factories should be sheltered and ready for wartime production and we will need to face possible rationing as well. Let's hope we can weather the storm."

SHO_merchant_fleet: "Expand the Merchant Fleet"

SHO_offensive_doctrine: "An Offensive Doctrine"
SHO_offensive_doctrine_desc: "Attack is the best defence, that’s how the saying goes. While we might not march into Berlin just yet we will use fierce counter attacks and terrorist actions against any enemy invader. They should regret ever setting foot on our lands."

SHO_civilian_militias: "Form Civilian Militias"
SHO_civilian_militias_desc: "We will expand military training to all civilians aged 18-60 to eventually form independently acting militias ready to support our regular troops. These reserves will significantly boost the manpower we can field."

SHO_develop_anti_tank: "Produce Anti-Tank Weaponry"
SHO_develop_anti_tank_desc: "We don't have the industrial capacity to field our own tanks in any significant numbers, but what we can do is create anti tank weapons, be it guns, mines, rifles you name it. We will equip our own tank hunter units with these and give 'em hell!"

SHO_resistance_doctrine2: "Propagate a Doctrine of Resistance"
SHO_resistance_doctrine2_desc: "It is clear that we will face brutal attacks, but we can not give in, the German retaliation against our defiance will be brutal, Valkism will destroy any semblance of our culture and what we hold dear. Yet many of our men are mere conscripts. It is important that we instil utter fear and fanaticism against this Valkist menace to they don't get any ideas of deserting."

SHO_canal_bunkers: "Fortify the Channel"

SHO_fighter_programme: "Create a Fighter Programme"

SHO_defensive_doctrine: "A Defensive Doctrine"
SHO_defensive_doctrine_desc: "It will be wise to learn from the Great War and dig in. We should conserve our forces and establish a strong multi-layered defensive line.Bunkers, barbed wire and machine guns should make any advance a gruelling task. It might not be the Rhenish line but it will be formidable."

SHO_protect_supply: "Protect our Supply Lines"

SHO_anti_air: "Install Anti-Air Positions"
SHO_anti_air_desc: "What we lack in an air force, we can compensate with AA-guns. Our new Flak positions will make Kiel airspace deadly to any Pilot of the Reich."

SHO_Brit_deal_desc: "We already know that the British are reasonable people we can deal with. We will send a delegation to London, outlining our desire to join their alliance as a valuable ally against Germany and offer them docking rights as well as rights to station troops. Let's find new friends across the channel."

SHO_Support_opposition: "Supply German Resistance Groups"
SHO_Support_opposition_desc: "It is well known that there are still those in Germany that despise Dressler and Valkism. We should make contact with these cells and support them in whatever way we can. If they rise up in rebellion behind any lines, it could be the crucial support we need."
SHO_Support_opposition_tt: "States with §R50% Attitude and below§! towards Germany's §YCultural Revolution§! will have negative modifiers."

SHO_Liberate_Germany: "The Second Brothers War"
SHO_Liberate_Germany_desc: "Our time is now. We finally march against Dressler. It is quite ironic that both brotherwars had our little Kiel at its centre."

SHO_SDPSH_victory: "SPSH Victory"
SHO_SDPSH_victory_desc: "In an unexpected turn of events, the SPDSH have secured the government for themselves. The SPD was always a major force in Kiel but suffered during the early 30s when many turned to agrarian parties or communists instead after the failure of the Hermann Müller government in Germany. Now it seems like the SPSH has a second although smaller chance to prove themselves. Their moderat centrism and promises for stability swayed many voters to their side, with even some of the moderate centre parties seeing this as a chance and pledging to support a new Great Coalition."

SHO_social_economics: "Social Market Economy"
SHO_social_economics_desc: "The SPD was always against the radicalism of communism, instead they favoured a fair market system that protects the worker through strong social systems, trade unions and worker rights. The state would keep the right to intervene in the economy to ensure a fair competition, break any trusts and prevent businesses from becoming too influential. This is decried as social Valkism by many on the left however."

SHO_support_unemployed: "Support for the Unemployed"
SHO_support_unemployed_desc: "The unemployment numbers rose dramatically during the last 10 years and with them all kinds of social issues and political strife. Unemployment is one of the most pressing problems, besides the Valkist threat and therefore we will need to combat it as fiercely as possible. Besides housing programs and soup kitchens, we will create work battalions and invest in large scale infrastructure projects to offer employment. This should hopefully alleviate the issue over time. "

SHO_nationalize_foreign_industries: "Seize Foreign Assets"
SHO_nationalize_foreign_industries_desc: "Currently many foreign investors and companies hold important assets in our harbours and the Kiel channel. Many of them were unlawfully acquired during the occupation and therefore need to be returned to the state. We can not allow foreign speculators to have a say in these vital parts of our economy."

SHO_expand_public_works: "Expand Public Works"
SHO_expand_public_works_desc: "To aid our economic rejuvenation, we will greatly expand the public projects and cut funding for the ineffective rural subsidies instead. It is clear that these projects will help reduce unemployment and breathe new energy into our struggling economy."

SHO_free_healthcare: "Supply Affordable Healthcare"
SHO_free_healthcare_desc: "Our government will begin the creation of a system to provide affordable social services to the working man of our nation, most importantly a well functioning healthcare system, something severely underdeveloped as of now."

SHO_rural_education: "Expand Rural Education"
SHO_rural_education_desc: "We shall create schools in rural areas to teach the future generation and bring modern ideas and values to those areas, in an attempt to bridge the divide between city and land. Many are still homeschooled and can not allow Völkish aligned organisations to influence rural education."

SHO_state_supported_unions: "Create Democratic Trade Unions"
SHO_state_supported_unions_desc: "Many trade unions are either communist or the völkisch farmer unions. We need to create a functioning system of democratic social trade unions that support the working class and keep radicalism at bay. These trade unions will be an important pillar of our government efforts."

SHO_bastion_of_german_democracy: "The Bastion of German Democracy"
SHO_bastion_of_german_democracy_desc: "Ahead of us lies a great struggle, a struggle for the freedom of the German people. From our tiny state in the north, the duty falls to us to bring back the German Republic, to overthrow the corrupt reactionaries to the south who are ready to doom Germany to an unwinnable war. Even if the road ahead is grim and difficult, we must stand firm as the fort that will hold out against all tyrannical attempts to enslave the German people."

SHO_hit_and_run: "Hit and Run Tactics"
SHO_hit_and_run_desc: "Quick attacks and swift retreats will be our tactic of choice when dealing with numerically superior forces. We will need to be creative once we face the Reichswehr. If our troops are swift enough, they will have trouble properly reacting to our movements and that's exactly what we need."

SHO_expand_kiel_fjords_forts: "Further Fortification Efforts"
SHO_expand_kiel_fjords_forts_desc: "It is clear that the city of Kiel and its surroundings need to be defended as well, not only the border. We will create a dense ring of bunkers and command positions, to ward off any naval invasion or airborne attacks."

SHO_establish_free_ports: " Establish Free Ports"
SHO_establish_free_ports_desc: "With political tension rising, we can be a neutral zone in Europe, at least trade wise and offer free harbours with very low tariffs as trade hubs between the political blocks. This will surely bring capital and trade interest to our nation."

SHO_help_the_Kieler_Bank: "Bail out the Kieler Bank"
SHO_help_the_Kieler_Bank_desc: "The Kieler Bank has been in a deep crisis for years now. In our efforts to centralise the banking system, we will bail out this old institution and partially nationalised it in an effort to stabilise our economy. "

SHO_invite_krupp: "Invite Krupp"
SHO_invite_krupp_desc: "The Germaniawerft is one of the largest shipbuilding companies of central Europe. Now that Germany is nationalising its military industry, we should reach out and contact Krupp to offer him and his family as well as close circle refugees in Kiel in exchange for him expanding his business ventures here. We could certainly profit a lot from the vast knowledge on military technology they have to offer."

SHO_heart_of_industry: "The Heart of Northern Industry"
SHO_heart_of_industry_desc: "Our efforts are fruitful. Kiel is on its best way to become one of the most important trade hubs of northern Europe. Our industry is booming and unemployment is dwindling. This success has earned us much favour in the population as well as the needed resources to further expand the arms and industry of Kiel."

# Post-War
SHO_spartacus_avenged: "Spartacus Avenged"
SHO_spartacus_avenged_desc: "In a totally unexpected and yet historically just outcome, we have triumphed over the vile evil of Valkist Germany. Once socialism was but a dream on the horizon for the German people - yet now we shall bring it to all of Germany!"

SHO_commence_devalkification: "Commence Devalkification"
SHO_commence_devalkification_desc: "The Valkist plague runs deep in society. Even the children suffer as they have been misled into believing Valkist lies, making the achievement of communism near impossible. We must thus commence a campaign to eliminate these elements."

SHO_strengthen_the_security_apparatus: "Strengthen the Security Apparatus"
SHO_strengthen_the_security_apparatus_desc: "Despite our best efforts, Valkism and other reactionary garbage continues to make an impression on the people of Germany. The security apparatus has so far proven invaluable in crushing this traitorous dissent, and so they deserve a grand expansion."
SHO_strengthen_the_security_apparatus_tt: "Reduces the time it takes to complete fighting off §YWehrwolf cells§! in states by §G60 days§!."

SHO_reeducate_the_masses: "Reeducate the Masses"
SHO_reeducate_the_masses_desc: "The masses, while rightfully inheriting the power of the old reactionary machine, still have some dubious beliefs. Whether it is in harmful conspiracies of minorities owning everything or in the lies of the dangers of communism peddled by capitalists, we must teach them of the true design of the workers’ state."

SHO_crush_the_werwolf: "Crush the Werwolf"
SHO_crush_the_werwolf_desc: "Operating in the shadows, the Werwolf have proven to be an utter headache to the government, killing innocents and invoking terror amongst the population. Once and for all, we must annihilate these treacherous reactionaries totally if the socialist state is to be secured."
SHO_crush_the_werwolf_tt: "Reduces the time it takes to complete fighting off §YWehrwolf cells§! in states by another §G60 days§!."

SHO_reorganize_the_reich_economic_chamber: "Reorganize the Reich Economic Chamber"
SHO_reorganize_the_reich_economic_chamber_desc: "The old economic chamber was, while dreamt of by a harebrained racist still not entirely much worse than the capitalist system that it inherited. We must simply reorganize this system along true socialist lines to ensure that it is the workers who benefit - not reactionary party goons."

SHO_start_the_rationing: "Start the Rationing"
SHO_start_the_rationing_desc: "Times are tough, and Germany is in crisis. With these times, we cannot afford to let people simply take whatever they want. We must all conserve for the common good."

SHO_repeal_valkist_economic_laws: "Repeal Valkist Economic Laws"
SHO_repeal_valkist_economic_laws_desc: "Old Valkist laws do nothing but leave a bad impression on the state, not to mention that they inhibit the ability for workers to benefit. It is up to us to ensure that not a single reactionary idea or piece of legislation is left standing, open to exploitation by opportunists."

SHO_transition_to_market_socialism: "Transition to Market Socialism"
SHO_transition_to_market_socialism_desc: "The time has come to leave behind overt central planning. The free market after all is not inherently a gross capitalist invention, rather manipulated into capitalist possession. Through state management and the power of the workers, we can ensure that all Germans may prosper."

SHO_five_year_plan: "Five Year Plan"
SHO_five_year_plan_desc: "The central planning of the Soviet state leaves us with great awe and wonder. It was only through the beacon of the Soviet state that we were able to see Germany to victory, and it shall be their model of economics that we follow!"

SHO_stick_with_moskau: "Stick with Moscow"
SHO_stick_with_moskau_desc: "The Soviet line is the correct line - and furthermore we owe a great deal to the Soviets. Even in tough times, they have never seeked to crush us into dust, but rather to aid us along in the goal of world revolution - which we shall achieve together!"

SHO_proclaim_the_fourth_internationale: "Proclaim the Fourth Internationale"
SHO_proclaim_the_fourth_internationale_desc: "The old Muscovite state turned red empire is cruel and bastardised the name of Marx and Engels. Only the home of these eminent communist revolutionaries can carry on their legacy to the whole world."

SHO_dealing_with_separatists: "Dealing with Separatists"
SHO_dealing_with_separatists_desc: "In a great tragedy, separatist states in all regions of Germany have formed. Of course, such a \"state\" is nothing more than a foreign imperialist ploy to depose the German worker of power, and hence we must deal with them at once!"

SHO_rhine: "The Ghosts of 1923"
SHO_rhine_desc: "In a strange turn of events, the Rhenish free staters have won out as their masters in Paris have wished, and now they play tyrant over the workers of the Rhine. Even self-proclaimed socialists betray their idiocy by advocating for workers’ revolution within a Rhenish state - how foolish! We shall deal with them at once!"

SHO_bavaria: "The Reactionary Outpost"
SHO_bavaria_desc: "First an outpost of reactionary separatism during the era of the Kaiserreich and then Republic, Bavaria and the southern states have always proven resistant to any sort of revolution. Yet, they were always eager to embrace the ultimate harbinger of reaction, Valkism and hence their current status cannot be let to stand."

SHO_prussia: "Liberation of the East"
SHO_prussia_desc: "The Prussian state has always had a great many people who chafed beneath the tyranny of the Junkers and their dogs in the military. Although their power has been smashed by proletarian and historical justice, their evil remnants continue to linger on as a puny state in the east - whose proletariat we shall liberate!"

SHO_look_onwards: "The New Situation"
SHO_look_onwards_desc: "With Germany secured, we may now turn to the outside world. Yet, the new world is in many ways highly alien to the old world that we are familiar with. As new powers have risen and old powers fallen, the German revolution must find a way to march on."

SHO_reach_out_to_norway: "Reach out to Norway"
SHO_reach_out_to_norway_desc: "The Norwegians have held onto the socialist truth, and are a people who we can get along with without much difficulty. We must reach out to them, and form a socialist belt that will land Scandinavia into the international revolution’s hands."

SHO_intervention_in_spain: "Intervention in Spain"
SHO_intervention_in_spain_desc: "Our Spanish brothers-in-arms have much history with us, whether it was on the fields of Catalonia or the forests of Hanover, international worker solidarity has found fewer greater examples than in our comradeship. Now, it is time that we return the favour and bring the international revolution to Spain!"

SHO_allies_in_madrid: "Allies in Madrid"
SHO_allies_in_madrid_desc: "With our Spanish comrades now free, let us reach out to them for an alliance that will keep the liberal imperialists of Paris and Rome on their toes. Together, the international revolution shall spread further!"
