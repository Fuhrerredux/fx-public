HEJ_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Throughout centuries of adversity, Arab people held onto a dream—a dream of a united and liberated Hejaz. With the support of the British, Arabs initiated a revolt against Ottoman rule. Regrettably, not everything unfolded as planned, and the Arabs remain far from achieving complete unity.\n\nDespite these challenges, it's undeniable that substantial progress has been made. Arabia is now a developing and modernizing nation, thanks to the wise leadership of King Abdulilah, the son of Ali and grandson of Hussein, who played a crucial role in liberating this land. However, not all within Arabia are content, as the houses of Al Rashid and Al Saud pose internal threats to the Kingdom."

### Events
hejaz.0.t: "The Arabian Peninsula, 1936"
hejaz.0.d: "As the Great War rages on, the current Emir and Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, have led a great revolt against the Ottoman oppresors, to free the holy lands from Constatinople and proclaim an independent Arabian state. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the Great War, the Entente powers, mainly France and Britain have carved out the Ottoman Empire, Lebanon and some areas falling to the French sphere of influence are created to a French Protectorate of Phoenicia, the British, unsurprisingly, created the Protectorate of the Mashriq Kingdom, with a Hashemite on the throne, Faisal I of Iraq; and in the case of the Arabian peninsula, the British kept their promise and recognized and supported a new independent Arabian state under Hussein bin Ali, the King of Hejaz, and the British went over and provided aid to modernize the newly independent kingdom, albeit at the cost of British influence in the politics of hejaz.\n\nAs pilgrims from Nejd were denied access from entering the holy places in Hejaz, the Emirate of Nejd began military campaigns against Hejaz and advancing towards Taif. Sharif Hussein briefly requested British assistance to the matter, with the British a limited volunteer force, military advisors and material support. Armed with British support and officers, men of the Royal Hejazi Armed Forces turned the tide and pushed through the territories of Nejd, capturing Riyadh, a month later. As the Hejazi army captured Riyadh, the Emirate of Nejd capitulated and its territories were integrated into the newly proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of hejaz."
hejaz.0.a: "May Allah guide us on our path!"
hejaz.1.t: "Village Raided by the Ikhwan!"
hejaz.1.d: "One of our patrols in the Nejd region has stumbled across what remains of a smouldering village. The few panicked survivors first tried to hide from our unit but after one of our soldiers took off his cap and set aside his rifle, one of the survivors managed to get over his fear and tell a horrible story about the camel riders of the east who swarmed in to take prisoners off as slaves. Anyone who resisted did not see much fruit for their labours. Another soldier calls out that he can make out a faint trail moving east but a sandstorm appears to be moving up from the south..."
hejaz.1.a: "After them!"
hejaz.1.b: "We'll never make it"
hejaz.2.t: "Army Attack on Nejd"
hejaz.2.d: "In a brazen move, aimed at stopping the Ikhwan raids amongst our subjects, we have sent a detachment of the Hejazi army deep into the desert to raid their oases. Supported with modern rifles and air support, their Ikhwan stood no chance at stopping us but they were able to harass the Hejazi columns before retreating back into the deserts."
hejaz.2.a: "And don't come back!"
hejaz.3.t: "Arrival of British Oil Prospectors"
hejaz.3.d: "At 3pm in this warm afternoon a cruiser ship carrying some British civillians and some cargo have arrived in the port city of Jeddah. Among the civillians onboard are some British oil prospectors hoping to find some more oil deposits in the most remote and unexplored areas of the Kingdom. Fired with enthusiasm, after unboarding the ship, they quickly organized their equipment and belongings and proceeded to board a train en-route to the Nejd region. Whether this adventure will bear fruit, only time will tell."
hejaz.3.a: "I hope they find something!"
hejaz.4.t: "Prospectors Reported Missing"
hejaz.4.d: "The foreign office have received a telegram from the [ENG.GetAdjective] consulte that the prospectors that arrived in our kingdom have not yet reported to either to their families, company and consulate. Equipped with the state of the art devices, the consulate of [ENG.GetNameDef] are worried that something have happened to the prospectors. The government have already proceeded to conduct a mission to search the whole Arabian peninsula but no results have come up yet."
hejaz.4.a: "Oh no..."
hejaz.5.t: "A Tragedy in Al-Hasa"
hejaz.5.d: "As our garrison units are roaming around the region of Al-Hasa, they spotted something peculiar. Upon coming near on some kind of a small oasis, they confirmed that they have found a couple of body, one still quite alive, on his last breath. As our units approached the remaining alive, he said his last words, namely, \"Ikhwan\" before ultimately dying. Our units carried the bodies and returned here in the capital. The [ENG.GetAdjective] consulate were informed of this tragedy and the ambassador are preparing to inform London."
hejaz.5.a: "This could get ugly."
hejaz.6.t: "British Prospectors Found Dead in Al-Hasa!"
hejaz.6.d: "The foreign office have received a telegram from our consulate in Mecca that the prospectors exploring the vast deserts of the Arabian peninsula have been found dead by Hashemite troops patrolling the region. It seems that the rebelling and hostile Ikhwan tribes still hiding in the remote areas of the kingdom are the ones responsible. The intelligence services, together with the Royal Air Force have pinpointed one our their hiding locations and are ready to strike back; but some in the government only demands an apology from the Hashemite Government, and try helping them defeat the Ikhwans."
hejaz.6.a: "Demand an apology from [HEJ.GetAdjective] Government!"
hejaz.6.b: "Conduct a RAF strike in the region!"
hejaz.7.t: "[ENG.GetName] Conducts an Air Strike"
hejaz.7.d: "The [ENG.GetAdjective] Royal Air Force with airbases in the Trucial States, have launched an air operation to avenge the killing of the [ENG.GetAdjective] civillians in Al-Hasa by the Ikhwan tribesmen. Reports from the [ENG.GetAdjective] consulate states that as many as 100 were confirmed to be dead from the conducted air operation."
hejaz.7.a: "Welp, the [ENG.GetAdjective] did our job."
hejaz.8.t: "Oil Deposits Found on Al-Hasa"
hejaz.8.d: "The [ENG.GetAdjective] prospectors exploring the vast deserts of the Arabian peninsula have found their gold; liquid gold that is. They have successfully found an oil deposit near the region of Al-Hasa. They have returned to the capital, Mecca to celebrate their success in the [ENG.GetAdjective] consulate."
hejaz.8.a: "Let the oil flow..."
hejaz.9.t: "[ENG.GetAdjective] Government Demands an Apology"
hejaz.9.d: "The [ENG.GetAdjective] Government, following the paths of diplomacy have demanded that we issue an apology on the killing on the [ENG.GetAdjective] prospectors killed by the Ikhwan tribesmen. They stated that it was our partial fault in the tragedy as we have still failed in repressing Ikhwan raids on the former territories of the Emirate of Nejd."
hejaz.9.a: "Fine, we'll do it."
hejaz.10.t: "[HEJ.GetAdjective] Government Issues an Apology"
hejaz.10.d: "The [HEJ.GetAdjective] Foreign Ministry have issued a formal apology on behalf of the killings of the [ENG.GetAdjective] prospectors by the hostile Ikhwan tribes in the former territories of Nejd. They state that in order to preserve the friendship of the two countries, the kingdom will accept our responsibilities and pledged to suppress the remaining hostile Ikhwan raiders terrorizing the eastern remote parts of the Kingdom."
hejaz.10.a: "Great."
hejaz.11.t: "Black Wednesday Hits the Desert"
hejaz.11.d: "As our kingdom's economy is tied with the British economy and to an extent the \"Commonwealth\" the stock market crash have proved to be catastrophic for our own home market. The effects are now being felt into by the common Arab and oil trade has now come to an all time low."
hejaz.11.a: "May Allah help us..."
hejaz.12.t: "Whispers from Najd"
hejaz.12.d: "As servants woke the king, he was greeted by a rather calm and warm morning, a rather different from the cold windy nights that the Arabian people have been accustomed to from the few months. He then proceeded to sit in the balcony to have his breakfast. Eating midway between his meal, a service car stopped onto the palace doors, the foreign minister hurriedly rushed out from the vehicle, dropping a few papers in the process. He then asked the Royal secretary to have an appointment with the king urgently.\n\nAs the king finished eating his breakfast, he then proceeded to meet the foreign minister; \"Your Highness, British Intelligence informed us that a revolt in the Najd region might be incoming. We are advised to be ready.\" Upon saying this, the foreign minister, noticed the King was not suprised at all, and the King then proceeded to speak, \"We should have expected this, the Sauds are not the ones who will give up that easily. Inform the Generals about this, we must be ready; and try requested for an aid from London; they would not let us go down.\". The foreign minister bowed his head and proceeded to leave the palace."
hejaz.12.a: "May Allah help us in this coming storm"
hejaz.13.t: "Saudi Loyalists has risen up!"
hejaz.13.d: "Disaster has struck! The intelligence report passed on by the British is indeed genuine and Saudi loyalists have risen up and proclaimed the Third Saudi State. War is imminent."
hejaz.13.a: "Stand with the Hashemites"
hejaz.13.b: "Stand with the Saudis (Play as the Emirate of Najd)"
hejaz.14.t: "Rashidi Loyalists has risen up!"
hejaz.14.d: "Capitalizing the catastrophe we are currently in, the small set of Rashidi loyalists in the northern states, have risen up. The situation is turning worse and worse."
hejaz.14.a: "Stand with the Hashemites"
hejaz.15.t: "Supporting the Hashemites"
hejaz.15.d: "The effects of the London Stock Market Crash has rippled from Europe, to the new world and onto the Middle East; it's aftermatch however, is much worse on the Hashemite kingdom in Arabia, sensing weakness and instability brought by the crash, multiple rebelling groups have rosen up and resumed conflicts in the peninsula. Officials from the foreign ministry of the kingdom have telephoned our consulate in Mecca, appealing material support in the conflict. As we are in an economic crisis ourselves, some in the government have opposed aiding the Hashemites against their conflict, but some expressed their concerns that Britain should do everything it can to guarantee the survival of the kingdom, as to protect British interests in the region."
hejaz.15.a: "Fine, send them what they need"
hejaz.15.b: "Send them a limited amount"
hejaz.15.c: "We cannot spare anything"
hejaz.16.t: "[From.GetName] Sends Support"
hejaz.16.d: "Responding to our appeals of material support on this conflict against the Saudis and Rashidis, the [ENG.GetAdjective] have sent a generous amount of material support to ensure our survival in the conflict."
hejaz.16.a: "Great, we need the help we can get"
hejaz.17.t: "[From.GetName] Sends Limited Support"
hejaz.17.d: "Responding to our appeals of material support on this conflict against the Saudis and Rashidis, the [ENG.GetAdjective] have sent a limited amount of material support to ensure our survival in the conflict."
hejaz.17.a: "Well its better than nothing"
hejaz.18.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses to Send Support"
hejaz.18.d: "Responding to our appeals of material support on this conflict against the Saudis and Rashidis, the [ENG.GetAdjective] have refused to send material support to help us defeat our rivals."
hejaz.18.a: "We're fools to trust the imperialists"
hejaz.19.t: "Defeat of the [From.GetAdjective]s"
hejaz.19.d: "As our army marched to the capital of [From.GetName]; the capitulation of the [From.GetAdjective] Government have soon followed. The last holdouts of the [From.GetAdjective] troops have now successfully seized and destroyed and the instrument of formal surrender have now signed by their delegation."
hejaz.19.a: "Glory to Allah!"
hejaz.20.t: "Pilgrims Arrive in Mecca"
hejaz.20.d: "A day before the official start of the Hajj, there are pilgirms already starting to arrive in different parts of the Muslim world. Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Turkish and other ethnicities performing the Islamic faith are settling in on the city of Mecca. The Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage, a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and of supporting their family during their absence from home. The rites of pilgrimage are performed over five to six days, extending from the 8th to the 12th or 13th of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar."
hejaz.20.a: "Come, fellow Muslims from different corners of the world!"
hejaz.21.t: "Question of Reforms"
hejaz.21.d: "The kingdom's style of leadership have roots since the Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Hasani conquest of Medina in 968. The kings, sultans and emirs have been always an absolute monarch since the dawn of time. But times have changed, and some, including the [ENG.GetAdjective] Consul, that in order for the kingdom to survive in this progressive times, we must transition to a more consitutional approach in which the king will reign, but not govern. While some applaud the idea of becoming a constitutional monarchy, some in the government, who are the more conservative type, are unsurprisingly, opposed to it; citing that the kingdom needs the strong king in order to survive in this difficult times, and it is the king's divine right to rule. But of course, it is the King's prerogative whether we wants a hands-on approach in governance or have a representative of him govern his nation."
hejaz.21.a: "The king decides against it"
hejaz.21.b: "The king accepts to relinquish his powers to the legislature."
hejaz.22.t: "Arabia Nationalizes the Oil Fields"
hejaz.22.d1: "After the complete deterioration of Arabian and British relations and their deparature from the British sphere of influence, the Hashemite Government have proceeded to nationalise the assets of the British companies in charge of the oil deposits. While we could technically reverse this action by waging war against them, it can be a hit on our public relations."
hejaz.22.a: "Impose an embargo on them"
hejaz.22.b: "We must protect British interests in the region!"
hejaz.23.t: "The Lion in the Room"
hejaz.23.d: "As the Hashemite dynasty asserted itself to be the dominant family all over the Arabian peninsula once again, we must address a more dominant issue plaguing our kingdom since its founding after the Great War, the British."
hejaz.23.a: "We must persue Arab unification against the British!"
hejaz.23.b: "We must be obedient to Westminster"
hejaz.24.t: "Arabia Snatches the Trucial States"
hejaz.24.d: "In an unprecendented move, the Hashemite Kingdom of Arabia, have seized our territories in the Arabian peninsula. At 6:0am local time, members of the Royal Hashemite Army have crossed the border and secured major cities like Abu Dhabi and and Kuwait. Local British garrisons were not able to repulse the upcoming Hashemite invasion and have surrendered hours after."
hejaz.24.a: "They will pay for this!"
hejaz.24.b: "They are not worth the war."
hejaz.25.t: "Invitation to the Mecca Pact"
hejaz.25.d: "We have been contacted by the [HEJ.GetAdjective] Government in [HEJ.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], they intend to extend the invitation to us in joining the [HEJ.GetFactionName]. The aim of this alliance is to secure and unify the Arabs countries in the region, and at the same time, combatting western imperialist influence in the middle east.."
hejaz.25.a: "A way for Arab unification"
hejaz.25.b: "This will never work"
hejaz.26.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Offer"
hejaz.26.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has decided to refuse our offer to join the [Root.GetFactionName]. We shall defeat the western imperialists without them."
hejaz.26.a: "We are better off without them"
hejaz.26.b: "They will join whether by force"
hejaz.27.t: "An Offer from Mecca"
hejaz.27.d: "While performing his daily duties as Emir of Libya, Idris, have been approached by a rather eccentric Arabian man, who claimed he was sent by [HEJ.GetNameDefCap]. He then proceeded to sit down, as told by Idris, and stated his business. It seems that the [HEJ.GetFactionName] or the [HEJ.GetAdjective]s, in general, are keen for Libya to escape the Italian shackles, offering for Idris to betray his [ITA.GetAdjective] masters, and join instead the Arabian alliance."
hejaz.27.a: "We are loyal to the hands that feeds us."
