AUS_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Once one of the greatest empires in Europe, the Austrian nation has been beaten, broken and battered into being a rump state, considered among many as one of the few unsaveable nations from the newly awakened Germany’s wrath.\n\nBut must this be so? Even if the republic faces great difficulty in all sorts of things, the Austrian people still desire freedom and life. Many political factions in the country await their opportunity - to give the Austrian people freedom and once and for all cement a new Austria for a new age."

AUS_treaty_of_saint_germain_desc: "The Treaty of Saint-Germain was imposed on Austria by the Entente in 1919; the treaty put an end to Austria-Hungary and the Austrian Empire, 60% of the Austrian land was taken by other nations, the Austrian Forces were limited to 30.000 men, and the military factories were to be dismantled. Austria didn't have to pay reparations, but even so, the land taken away and the humiliation of the treaty has not been forgotten by the population.\n\nEven though the treaty took a toll on the industry, the Austrians know how to circunvent the treaty. The tradition began with the second chancellor. Ignaz Speil would use paramilitary organisations to keep the military afloat, and more importantly, to keep the populus quiet.\n\nNegotiations between Austria and the Entente Council are regular, the Austrians trying as much as they can to lower the effects of the treaty, and through negotiations, the Entente changed the limit from 30,000 men to 70,000 men in 1923.\nIn June 1935, Austrian delegates at the Entente Council demanded the nullification of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, they argued that the Entente and Austria should cooperate together against the German revanchism, and so, a session is to be held on January 1937."

austria.1.t: "The Status of Austria"
austria.1.d: "In 1914, the Austrian Empire had entered the Great War with high hopes for victory, both to assert their dominance over Serbia, and to avenge the life of the Archduke. However, not all was well for them, as they found themselves getting thrown back more and more on every front they fought. The Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary were on edge. They were finally pushed off of it in 1918, the Weltkrieg was over, Austria-Hungary fell, and in that fall, Austria would emerge as a separate nation once again. Hungary is a republic, and so is Austria now; they have both exiled their former emperor and princes. The Weltkrieg, a conflict started by Austria, would be the final nail in the coffin for the Austrian Empire.\n\nThe treaty which concluded Austria’s fate would prove worse than what many had thought possible. Austria would not only lose a majority of its territory, but it would even lose the privilege to have a respectable fighting force, constricted at a paltry thirty-thousand men not to mention ruinous reparations. To the Austrians, Austria had lost its independence - stripped of their liberty and their destiny put in the hands of the French. Revanchism thus took hold in Austria, from the communists to valkists.\n\nIn 1919 and 1920, the Austrian government made several attempts to unify with the German Republic to the north, but to no avail, as the Entente continued to reject any form of unification between the two nations. On 1 October 1920, the Austrian constitution was enacted and elections were soon called. The parliamentary elections of 1920 saw the Social Democrats lose their majority in parliament, and the new majority in the senate was the CSP. The CSP continued to have a comfortable majority for most of the years between 1920 and 1927, when their majority was almost broken.\n\nIn January 1927, nationalists attacked Schutzbund members heading back to the train station, injuring several and killing two people, one of them being an eight-year-old boy. These deaths were controversial, and their funeral on 2 February was attended by thousands, with trade unions declaring a 15-minute general strike throughout Austria to mark the funeral. On 5 July, the trial of three Frontkämpfervereinigung members who were accused of the shooting began in Vienna. After nine days, the jury acquitted them. This revolted the nation, and on 15 July, a revolt was called. It began with strikes, but after the police used force, the socialist militias began to open fire on the police and reactionary militias. In the end, the Landwehr had to be called in to disperse the revolt, but even after the revolt ended, Heimwehr militias broke into the homes of SPÖ-KPO-affiliated citizens and murdered them and their families. The April Revolt left a deep wound in the Austrian political system. After the revolt ended, SPÖ demanded justice for the families and workers who were shot and killed in the night raids, but not much was being done with the CSP government in place, and so in December 1929, another revolt was called, this time by the KPÖ.\nThe 1929 Revolt was the spark for the Austrian Civil War, the SPÖ sided with the government, this decision damaged even further their reputation. The civil war ended in January 1930, one month after the initial skirmishes. On the 12th of April 1930, there was an attempt by the Heimwehr to take over the government, however, it was quickly defeated and the many allies of then-chancellor Karl Buresch were dismissed. In 1931, the chancellor himself was dismissed and Engelbert Dollfuß would take over.\n\nAs a new year dawns, the international political climate has certainly changed for the worse. Germany in the north is looking increasingly revanchist, seeking unification with Austria by any means necessary. Our southern protector in Rome meanwhile faces internal problems that could interfere in a future decision to protect Austria from the Germans. Finally, France, the main enemy of Germany, and \"protector\" of Austria has been dealing with internal strife - endless strikes, extremist opposition clashing with each other in the streets and its military in shambles...It would be safe to assume that France is the new \"Sick man of Europe\".\n\nIn Austria, internal politics have also riled up once more, with the valkists having received guns and support from Germany to continue and deepen their operations, the communists have now created their own front to fight the valkists, the \"Front of National Freedom\". These two political forces have been at clashes with each other for at least 3 years now and it only intensifies with each year. The parliament is dominated by the conservative right while a sufficient social-democrat left opposition has gained support due to the conservative failure of protecting the streets and their own independence. It is safe to assume that Austria is alone in this new era, an era of brutal political violence."

# Black Wednesday

AUSperfecteconomy.1.t: "Black Wednesday"
AUSperfecteconomy.1.d: "As news of the London stock exchange crash spreads through Austria, panic grips the streets as looting and violence become common. The crash, following a prolonged decline, has sent shockwaves through the European economy, leading to a spiral of poverty, as millions of enterprises shutting down and millions of workers lost their jobs. As the panic continued in the banks, people ran to the banks to withdraw their money and maybe save their savings. This culminated in banks shutting down and withdrawals being outright refused. The crisis has reached its peak, if we allow it to worsen further, the military may intervene, and our economy may never recover completely..."
AUSperfecteconomy.1.a: "May God help us..."

AUSperfecteconomy.2.t: "The Worst is Over"
AUSperfecteconomy.2.d: "Black Wednesday had a horrifying effect on the Austrian economy and the living standards of the country. However, the worst days are over, and now we can attempt a full recovery."
AUSperfecteconomy.2.a: "Towards economic recovery!"

AUSperfecteconomy.3.t: "Weapons to the Heimwehr"
AUSperfecteconomy.3.d: "The infamous Treaty of Saint-Germain states that any military factory must be approved and reviewed by the council before construction can begin. However, it does not state that the council must approve the government's purchase of a privately owned factory for military purposes. There is an obstacle, however, in that no equipment can be produced for the military; instead, all of it must be redirected to the civilians to purchase. The Heimwehr, however, is still considered a civilian organization with no ties to the military."
AUSperfecteconomy.3.a: "The best we can do at the moment."

AUSperfecteconomy.4.t: "The Austrian Proposal to the Entente"
AUSperfecteconomy.4.d: "In June 1935, Austrian delegates at the Entente Council demanded the nullification of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, citing the reasons for it as: “A measure of defence against a revanchist Germany that is starting to rearm itself, and to guarantee the Entente and Austrian safety, Austria should also begin to rearm”. The session that would decide whether the treaty would or not be nullified was held on the first of January, 1937. The Serbians opposed the Austrian demands, citing the rearmament of Austria as a “means to reconquer their empire”, however, the effects of Black Wednesday and the continuation of Dressler’s policy of revanchism gave the French and Italians the reasoning to accept the Austrian demands. In the end, it was decided that the Treaty of Saint-Germain would be nullified and Austria was permitted full rearmament."
AUSperfecteconomy.4.a: "The Treaty of Saint-Germain is finally dead."

# Militias

AUSmilitias.1.t: "SDAPÖ and CSP Militias Fight at Vienna"
AUSmilitias.1.d: "Ever since the creation of the First Republic, militias gathered up in arms, trying to achieve revolution or silence the opposition. The Ostmärkische Sturmscharen (OS) is not generally seen on the battlefield, generally, the Heimwehr is the one to come looking for fights. The OS is a fighting force like no other though, being lead by prominent Kurt von Schuschnigg. On the other hand, the Republikanischer Schutzbund (RS) is a veteran of urban fighting, having survived years of brutal war - and being even more radicalised by the events of the 15th of July. The three main militias, Heimwehr, Ostmärkische Sturmscharen, and Republikanischer Schutzbund, are in constant battles throughout the country. However, today was bloodier than ''regular''.\n\nIn the streets of Vienna, squadrons of RS militias walked through the city, eventually finding themselves in a confrontation with OS militias, both armed and ready to fight. In a hurried tone, people started leaving as they realised fighting was about to commence. And then, a grenade was thrown at the OS. The fighting was heavy, but the OS militias suffered a total loss, with their squadrons forced to retreat by the RS, which suffered minimal losses. One interesting thing, though, is that grenades are military-grade equipment, that few in the military have access to.\n\nThat means that someone gave the RS military-grade equipment..."
AUSmilitias.1.a: "Something is going on behind the curtain..."

AUSmilitias.2.t: "Retaliation in Vienna"
AUSmilitias.2.d: "It was time for payback against the socialists. Their military-grade equipment and vicious brutality against innocent Austrians could only beget a single righteous response. For this, an alliance between the Heimwehr and the Ostmärkische Sturmscharen was struck. As they entered Vienna looking for blood, they would soon find however that the Republikanischer Schutzbund was waiting for them, armed and ready.\n\nIn the chaos that ensued, a hail of bullets and grenades were exchanged across the streets of Vienna. While few had expected the fight to be easy, ultimately the Republikanischer Schutzbund retreated surprisingly quickly, but with one piece of bad news came victory for the right-wing paramilitaries. In the struggle, a key officer of the Schutzbund had perished, well-loved by not just the paramilitary members but also the Viennese population. It seems that retribution for his death will come soon..."
AUSmilitias.2.a: "You fools, that will only entice the devil!"

AUSmilitias.3.t: "Strikes in Vienna"
AUSmilitias.3.d: "The furor over the death of the Schutzbund officer was expected to be great, but certainly not to the extent that we can now witness. With the Schutzbund at their beckoning, the Social Democrats have called for a general strike in Vienna until the government prosecutes the paramilitary men who shot down the Schutzbund officer.\n\nThis has caused a breakdown of regular life in the city, with other sympathy strikes already breaking out throughout the rest of the nation. Joining the crowd, radicals like Otto Bauer have strongly urged the government to take steps to begin prosecution of the Sturmscharen and Heimwehr units involved in the retributive strike, threatening failure to do so would indict them as nothing more than agents of reaction. Such a threat has not gone unnoticed, and has only served to radicalize the nation."
AUSmilitias.3.a: "And so the rats show their true face."

AUSmilitias.4.t: "Heimwehr Suppresses Strikers"
AUSmilitias.4.d: "Out of the many anti-socialist elements in Austria, few are as feared as the Heimwehr. While broadly speaking a simple anti-socialist patriotic paramilitary, the Heimwehr consists of the local organizations that across the Austrian provinces with each local Heimwehr organization having particular differences from one another. While this has historically made them unwieldy in fighting the government, such issues have now been overshadowed by the Vienna strikes.\n\nDecrying the strikes as nothing but Bolshevik provocation and once again demanding a severe crackdown on their nemesis in the Schutzbund, the Heimwehr have bypassed the government’s approval by taking the initiative and marching into Vienna to deal with the strikers. As blood runs through the streets of Vienna as Heimwehr forces beat down the socialist strikers, condemnation has come from all rungs of Austrian society including even the parliament. Still ,it appears that the chancellor himself has remained awfully tight-lipped on the day’s events as the Vienna strikes come to an unceremonious end."
AUSmilitias.4.a: "We can use this."

AUSmilitias.5.t: "The Death of Richard Steidle"
AUSmilitias.5.d: "The Heimwehr’s suppression of the Vienna strikes has turned out to be far less desirable than the Heimwehr leaders had hoped. The brutality with which the Heimwehr smashed the strikes shook even ardent conservatives with some openly fearing a Heimwehr dictatorship in the vein of Dressler to the north or like the Serbs in the south. Such a thought has caused the blood of many to run cold, but it has also caused many socialist sympathizers to begin throwing their lot in with the Schutzbund.\n\nOn this day in Graz, federal leader of the Heimwehr Richard Steidle was on his way to meet Styrian Heimwehr to plan ways out of the new challenges that the suppression of Vienna had brought. Whatever was running through his mind however will be for naught, as he was assassinated on his way to the meeting. The culprit was supposedly a lone communist, though most suspect that this assassin was actually put up to it by none other than the hated Schutzbund. Either way, there will be payback."
AUSmilitias.5.a: "They have crossed the line, begin military preparations."

AUSmilitias.6.t: "Ramek’s Order"
AUSmilitias.6.d: "It seems that on the orders of the chancellor, the army has begun preparations to crush the Republikanischer Schutzbund at once. Such a move though could only really spark further civil unrest, and even setting aside the outrage that this wholesale shift towards right-wing dictatorship could spark from Paris or Rome, the practical effect may not even be sufficient to stave off revolution. As such and in accordance with law, interior minister Rudolf Ramek has ordered the army to stop preparations and to demobilize - all is well.\n\nOf course not all is well. Chancellor Dollfuß for his part has made his pleasure abundantly clear. Still, the president and more moderate Christian-Socials has refused to let Dollfuß override Ramek’s order or even punish the wayward minister, though his fate in a future cabinet is highly dubious to say the least."
AUSmilitias.6.a: "A distasteful choice."

AUSmilitias.7.t: "Red Vienna Burning"
AUSmilitias.7.d: "Red Vienna, as it is called for the socialist activity has finally come to revolution. The elections have been post-poned due to widespread revolt and unreast all across Austria, with the delay of two months, with this revolution, it is certain that Austria is a step from the abyss.\n\nSome call this revolution a democratic revolution, however, we know that this revolution is simply a facade to install a socialist government. The Government is at an impasse on how to solve this issue, which caused the resignation of the President of the Nationalrat, meaning that the next President is the SDAPÖ representative, which will defitinely try to negotiate with the rioters."
AUSmilitias.7.a: "Great, socialists in the Presidency."


# Reforms

AUSreforms.1.t: "The Fiscal Reforms"
AUSreforms.1.d: "The state is undergoing massive problems with debt payments and keeping the state machinery working. To prevent further spiraling down the crisis, the economic minister of Austria has declared a state of austerity. State pensions to veterans will be revoked, and politicians' pay is being cut in half. All of these changes will continue in effect until the austerity state is dropped."
AUSreforms.1.a: "Anything to end this crisis!"

AUSreforms.3.t: "The Fate of Steyr-Daimler-Puch"
AUSreforms.3.d: "Steyr-Daimler-Puch is a military-based company that came into existence after the fusion of Steyr, Austro-Daimler and Puch into one company. The company has been in financial trouble ever since it came into existence due to the Treaty of Saint-Germain, however, Black Wednesday has made the financial trouble turn into financial ruin and now, the company faces bankruptcy. Since the company is the biggest armament company in Austria, the state is also being involved and some suggest intervention to prevent the company's bankruptcy."
AUSreforms.3.a: "Nationalise the Company"
AUSreforms.3.b: "Subside the company."
AUSreforms.3.c: "Don't intervene."

AUSprotests.1.t: "Protests Against Austerity in Wien"
AUSprotests.1.d: "Wien was thrown into a state of riots ever since the state of austerity has been declared. Many veterans of the Great War feel as if the measure is a spit in the face of those who put themselves at the front in the war to end all wars."
AUSprotests.1.a: "Damn it!"

# Socialist Terrorist

AUSterrorism.1.t: "Socialist Terrorism"
AUSterrorism.1.d: "As the socialists continue to resist our rule, their tactics of terrorism are hurting our system and revealing weakness in our regime. We must address these criminals as soon as possible."
AUSterrorism.1.a: "Damn it!"

# CS

# SDAPÖ

# Schuschnigg

ausks.1.t: "Talks with the Landbund"
ausks.1.d: "The Landbund, which was in opposition to the CS after the national crisis has agreed to talks. Inside the Nationalrat, the Landbund made themselves clear about supporting small farmers - they added on top of it, a declaration that land reform will not be carried out extensively."
ausks.1.a: "We hope to cooperate as one."
ausks.1.b: "What's this, a farmer's state?"

ausks.3.t: "The Weak Veil"
ausks.3.d: "Democracy, while still acting in the Austrian Empire, was checked by the noble power of the Emperor, after the Emperor went away, the French and Italian devils dismantled our institutions, they replaced those timeless institutions with a replica of their disease;\n\nParliamentarism - a weak, frail and disgusting institution. Those who lived under it can agree on one thing: Parliamentarism is a disgrace to the Austrian nation. With the Vaterland Front taking power, the SDAPÖ and KPO being radio silent, and Youth Organizations forced underground, the path is clear to us. It will finally be the time to put an end to the institution all of the "New Conservatives" hate. That is, democracy."
ausks.3.a: "Let it burn."

ausks.4.t: "Loud Speakers, Loud Actors"
ausks.4.d: "The ban on socialist parties of all stripes rather than just the tool of Soviet interference that is the KPÖ has endeared very few moderates. In fact, it has only emboldened the Republikanischer Schutzbund and their Social Democrat overlords to intensify resistance against our government. To this end, the question of severity still remains. Should we go all the way and ensure that every single Bolshevik organization is rooted out? Such a thing could require a level of total surveillance and control that would make moderates’ stomachs sink, necessitating a decision on the matter."
ausks.4.a: "Keep these troublemakers underground."
ausks.4.b: "No quarter."

ausks.5.t: "The Duel of Two Parties"
ausks.5.d: "The Republikanischer Schutzbund have always been the greatest threat to our vision of a godly, united and free Austria. Behind their misleading slogans of equality and liberal democracy, their best promote feeble parliamentarianism while their worst are practically begging hands and knees for a Soviet intervention into our country.\n\nThe rise of Schuschnigg has not caused them to back down either. In fact, they have never been bolder in desiring an overthrow of the government and the creation of a red state in South Europe. Never mind that such a state would be asking for an intervention from all sides, it would simply bring ruin upon the Austrian people. As they rally in their ghoulish factories to destroy the nation, we must prepare ourselves as we face down the Social Democrats for the fate of the Austrian nation. The Austrian people shall choose - bread or Bolshevism?"
ausks.5.b: "Let them come!"

ausks.6.t: "The Kingmaker’s Triumph"
ausks.6.d: "With the Heimwehr being slowly integrated via political extortion, their leader, Rüdiger would notice his isolation. Losing the will to continue his political career, it became apparent that retirement is the only choice. It is now a matter of time to see if Rüdiger will survive retirement."
ausks.6.a: "He will have a nice house in Lower Austria, believe me."

ausks.7.t: "United, Even in the Economy"
ausks.7.d: "The Austrian nation is diverse in thought, and one of those thoughts are the economic thought. Austrian debacle on the matter gained international attention, becoming a centre for all economists. However, with the London Crash, it was finally shown to the world the dangers of such methods.\n\nWith the crash came millions of people without work, money or food, internationally, a tragedy. For reasons like this that our Chancellor and his Cabinet decided to go further than simple regulations, the economy must work like a body. One where the brain controls and decides, with the other work being automated within the system."
ausks.7.a: "That should deal with the main problem."

ausks.8.t: "The Guide of Independent Austria"
ausks.8.d: "While we are German, Austria is more than just another German province to inevitably be bound to Prussian whims. We are more cultured in certain ways than our northern brothers would like to believe, and we certainly hold to our faith more strongly than even the supposedly devout Bavarians who were the first to give themselves up for the Bolshevik-esque Valkist movement.\n\nTo this end, Schuschnigg has called for a renewed effort on our part to separate ourselves from Germany. The rogue government in Berlin already hates us for simply being free, so let us return the favor and make the whole world understand that Austria will always be independent of a tyrannical Germany!"
ausks.8.a: "Austria will always be free!"

ausks.9.t: "Eliminating the German Networks"
ausks.9.d: "It is not news that the German Networks for Pan-Germanism are increasing. Ever since the degeat of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in the Great War, the gunpowder barrel exploded and nationalism and Pan-Germanism runs rampant. The problem with Pan-Germanism at the moment is that, we Austrians, cannot allow our independence to be played with, especially with Germany starting to renew their war machine.\n\nIf Austria is to remain independent, we must clean the rats out. Truth be told though, Dolfuss and Ramek have already been surpressing many of these movements in secrecy, but now we can eliminate them without any worries."
ausks.9.a: "Get these rats out of here!"

ausks.10.t: "Rejuvanating Austrian Nationalism"
ausks.10.d: "When our regime came to Austria, millions of Austrians commemorated, as the years of led would finally end. However, with time, that nationalism will eventually start cooling off, and Pan-Germanists count on that to destroy the Austrians from inside out.\n\nWe Austrians must not forget our actual roots. German or not, Austria should come first, in soul and body!"
ausks.10.a: "As it should be."

ausks.12.t: "Where Eagles Clash"
ausks.12.d: "As the German Empire and the Austrian Empire fell, a wave of nationalism came to the country, while at the same time, revolutionary thought swept through Europe. At the ends of the Habsburg Empire, Pan-Germanism would reemerge as once it did in 1848. However, the Entente wished for a Pan-German union to never happen, as Germany would have more territory than at the start of the war, and more importantly, they would have a greater industry.\n\nDuring the late 1920s, Austria would accept its status as an independent nation, even if the population disagreed. However, during the Valkist coup of 1932 in Germany, Pan-Germanist started to re-root itself in Austrian politics. Soon, Austria would discover that their northern neighbour no longer saw them as an independent country, it would be a matter of time until the Prussian eagle descended to catch its prey. Now, it is the time to prepare, and more importantly, impale the Prussian eagle!"
ausks.12.a: "At your feet, soldier!"

ausks.13.t: "Propaganda Department"
ausks.13.d: "Propaganda - A weapon, agaisnt all foes. Be it political or military, propaganda has a wide use for the government, we must convince the souls of the people that our cause is just, even if not. The creation of the propaganda department makes things easier for us, as we can operate with more organisation to spread our message. From now on, the people of Austria shall know the truth, and they shall be convinced of our justness!"
ausks.13.a: "Let them hear what we want."

ausks.14.t: "Maintaining Order at the Army"
ausks.14.d: "With our defences being prepared to ensure Austrian survival, it has come to Jansa's attention some officers, and high-ranking personnel had previous affiliation with the enemy. Today, a report from Jansa, where he advises the nation to "retire" these personnel."
ausks.14.a: "We should listen to Jansa."

ausks.15.t: "Schuschnigg, Father of Austria"
ausks.15.d: "For many international observers, Austria's fate would be simple - an hapless pawn of the newly arisen Reich that would go on to enthusiastically fight for barbaric conquest. However, their predictions have clearly been proven wrong. Despite all attempts by the radical government in Berlin, the Austrian people have withstood the attack of the new menace that was Germany and has in concert with the responsible nations of Europe smited the illegal regime from the Earth.\n\nWhile Valkism and its derivatives live on, they are but irrelevant embers of the once-grand flame that encompassed Europe. Meanwhile, Austria remains standing, ready to face the challenges of a new world. Sure, liberalism and its socialist companions still remain and in certain places are stronger than ever, but none can deny that we have won this war. Chancellor Schuschnigg has led our German Austria into a new age, and for this he can only be described as the father of the nation."
ausks.15.a: "Die neue Zeit steigt in den Tag!"

# Habsburg

AUShabsburg.1.t: "Politics and Art Intertwined"
AUShabsburg.1.d: "Hugo von Hofmannsthal entered the room where Otto was sitting, placing himself on the ottoman across the former royal. They were to sit down and create an Austrian identity unique from the division and fragmantation that had festered under a German identity. At the question from Otto, Hofmannsthal could give insight into how to form this identity.\n\nHe began talking about England. How the English admired both military leaders and artists alike, while maintaining their identity. How divisions between the politicians and the artists doesn't exist. Where the subjects are provided with a common base of energy, a singular and pragmatic energy.\n\nEven if these visions might be overstated, there were some teachings in them. Austria had produced many artists during her lifetime. Why bind our identity towards ethnicity or language? These things have easily divided the people, causing many Austrians to view themselves as German. Instead, both Hugo and Otto agreed that unity between politics, art and perhaps faith was the best way forward."
AUShabsburg.1.a: "The Austrian Has An Artist's Soul"

AUShabsburg.2.t: "The Social Monarchist Appointment"
AUShabsburg.2.d: "Ernst Karl Winter represents almost everything that makes Austria unique from Germany. A Catholic monarchist, Winter was an early proponent of the Austrian identity. One who also had a big heart for the rights of the Austrian working class. Now, he sat on his first cabinet meeting as an appointed member of Otto's government.\n\nWhile most of Otto's supporters strive towards the right, the appointment of Winter represent a turn towards the left. It was he who came with the slogan: 'stand on the right and think on the left'. His monarchism isn't one of elitism and intolerance. Quite the difference, his role will be to use his expertice from his work as a Journalist and University Professor to promote the Austrian identity in our education system. In addition, he will probably give a lot of input on issues in regards of workers' rights through his Social Working Group."
AUShabsburg.2.a: "For the Austrian Worker and His King"

AUShabsburg.3.t: "Changing of the Guard"
AUShabsburg.3.d: "Last week, president Wilhelm Miklas tendered his resignation to the Austrian parliament in a session overseen by Otto von Habsburg. Miklas have served the Austrian people faithfully through many years, but now it is over. With the changing times, new leadership, leadership more willing to work with Otto that is, will be needed to move Austria forward.\n\nA new session was quickly called this week to fulfill the vacancy left by Miklas' departure. During the session, Otto took to the stand, speaking about the need to nominate someone who will bring Austria into the future. He spoke about the instability, the divisions and intolerance of the Republic, painting a nicer picture of the Habsburg dynasty and the Empire. While some believed he would nominate himself, Otto instead ended the speech by nominating Viktor Dankl von Krasnik to follow Miklas as president.\n\nSome remaining opposition figures still oppose this nomination, pointing towards the advanced age of von Krasnik and his loyalties with the Monarchist Restoration Party. However, with our grasp over the Federal Council secure, there is nothing they can do to hinder this appointment. In the end, our Republican opponents will be right. Von Krasnik is old and will not live for long, but he will be a man willing to work with us to make the Imperial Crown ready for Otto in due time."
AUShabsburg.3.a: "For Austria's Future!"

AUShabsburg.4.t: "The Austrians Seeks a Trade Deal"
AUShabsburg.4.d: "Austria, under the leadership of their former crown prince Otto von Habsburg, have sent an envoy to Rome. They request a trade agreement between the two realms, seeking to bind closer connections between the Austrian and Italian peoples. While this agreement will be benefitial to us, we should keep in mind Otto's ambitions to restore the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. An empire that claimed Italian lands."
AUShabsburg.4.a: "Trade is Harmless, We Agree"
AUShabsburg.4.b: "No! We Can't Trust This Habsburg"

AUShabsburg.5.t: "The Italians Agree"
AUShabsburg.5.d: "Our envoy in Rome sends good news back to Vienna. The Italians have agreed on the terms of our trade agreement. With this agreement, both realms will be strengthen. We are hopeful that this is just the first step towards a prosperous relationship."
AUShabsburg.5.a: "Great!"

AUShabsburg.6.t: "The Italians Disagree"
AUShabsburg.6.d: "Our envoy in Rome sends bad news back to Vienna. The Italians did not see reason and rejected our proposed trade agreement. There are rumours that the Italians does not trust the leadership of an Habsburg in Austria, fearing for the lands that they took from us during the Great War. Despite this setback, we hope to uphold cordinal relations with them."
AUShabsburg.6.a: "You Can't Win Them All"

AUShabsburg.7.t: "The Austrians Seeks a Trade Deal"
AUShabsburg.7.d: "Austria, under the leadership of their former crown prince Otto von Habsburg, have sent an envoy to Sofia. They request a trade agreement between the two realms, seeking to bind closer connections between the Austrian and Bulgarian peoples. With an Habsburg ruling Austria, many see it as a prime opportunity to rekindle our relationship from the Great War. Others want us to reject this, in an rejection to the failures of the past."
AUShabsburg.7.a: "Trade is Harmless, We Agree"
AUShabsburg.7.b: "No! We Don't Want to Be Draged Into Otto's Ambitions"

AUShabsburg.8.t: "The Bulgarians Agree"
AUShabsburg.8.d: "Our envoy in Sofia sends good news back to Vienna. The Bulgarians have agreed on the terms of our trade agreement. With this agreement, both realms will be strengthen. We are hopeful that this is just the first step towards a prosperous relationship."
AUShabsburg.8.a: "Great!"

AUShabsburg.9.t: "The Bulgarians Disagree"
AUShabsburg.9.d: "Our envoy in Sofia sends bad news back to Vienna. The Bulgarians did not see reason and rejected our proposed trade agreement. There are rumours that an agreement with a Habsburg-led Austria reminds them too much about the failures of the Great War. Despite this setback, we hope to uphold cordinal relations with them."
AUShabsburg.9.a: "You Can't Win Them All"

AUShabsburg.10.t: "Austria Calls the Princes"
AUShabsburg.10.d: "Austria, under the leadership of the Habsburg prince Otto, has issued a call for the princes of the Habsburg line. One of these princes resides in Hungary. Joseph August has had a residence in our country since the end of the Great War, and has become a likeable figure for the public. Even many Hungarian nationalists view him with high regards and some seek to enthrone him as king of Hungary.\n\nIt would be hard to justify keeping him here if he want to return to his kin in Austria, but some advisors say we should keep him here. However, that would be a decision that could risk tensions with the Austrians."
AUShabsburg.10.a: "Farewell, Joseph August"

AUShabsburg.11.t: "Joseph August Arrives From Hungary"
AUShabsburg.11.d: "The Palatine of Hungary, Joseph August, have arrived today in Vienna. Despite his own doubts of leaving Hungary and the signs that the Hungarian government would try to keep him there, he answered the call. He understands that joining our forces isn't a betrayal to the Hungarian people. Soon enough, we will march east and liberate the Hungarian people from their Magyar oppressors."
AUShabsburg.11.a: "Welcome to Vienna"

AUShabsburg.12.t: "The Hungarians Has Hindered Joseph August"
AUShabsburg.12.d: "The Hungarians seem to not let Joseph August go free to join his kin in Vienna. Instead of letting him leave, they placed him under house arrest in a fancy Budapest residence. They are probably scared that such a popular figure among the Hungarian people should join his brothers in Austria. Regardless, this is highly inappropriate."
AUShabsburg.12.a: "Cursed These Magyars"

AUShabsburg.13.t: "Austria Calls the Princes"
AUShabsburg.13.d: "Austria, under the leadership of the Habsburg prince Otto, has issued a call for the princes of the Habsburg line. One of these princes resides in Poland. Karl Albrecht has had a residence in our country since the end of the Great War, and has found himself a good home in Poland. So much that he is known as a avid Polish patriot. Of course, he could leave if he wants to, but some rumours tells us he might also choose to stay in Poland. That he finds the peace of retirement more fulfilling than Imperial service."
AUShabsburg.13.a: "It's Up to Him"

AUShabsburg.14.t: "Karl Albrecht Arrives From Poland"
AUShabsburg.14.d: "The Silesian Prince, Karl Albrecht, have arrived today in Vienna. Despite his deep love for Poland and his previous service for Polish independence, he answered the call. He understands that loyalty to family sometimes overgo loyalty to an adopted country. Hopefully, our dream of a renewed empire have space for the Polish nation. One living in freedom and prosperity."
AUShabsburg.14.a: "Welcome to Vienna"

AUShabsburg.15.t: "Karl Albrecht Rejects the Call"
AUShabsburg.15.d: "A letter has been sent to us from Poland. It is signed by the Silesian Prince, Karl Albrecht, himself. He wishes Austria luck and all well under renewed Habsburg rule, but declines to leave for Vienna. Even if we dislike his choice to leave the family and support his adopted country, it was ultimately his choice and we can't force him to travel to Vienna against his will."
AUShabsburg.15.a: "Was Worth the Effort"

AUShabsburg.16.t: "Austria Calls the Princes"
AUShabsburg.16.d: "Austria, under the leadership of the Habsburg prince Otto, has issued a call for the princes of the Habsburg line. One of these princes resides in Ukraine. Wilhelm Franz, known in our tounge as Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, has had a residence in our country since the end of the Great War, and has found himself a good home in Ukraine. While his elder brother became a Polish patriot, Wilhelm Franz has been an avid supporter of Ukrainian independence. If he want to, he can leave. However, he is also likely to stay in Ukraine. That he finds his loyalty more to his adopted country than to family ties."
AUShabsburg.16.a: "It's Up to Him"

AUShabsburg.17.t: "Wilhelm Franz Arrives From Ukraine"
AUShabsburg.17.d: "The Ukrainian Colonel, Wilhelm Franz, have arrived today in Vienna. Despite his loyalty to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, he has answered the call. He understands that even if his heart is torn between Ukraine and family, he can't forget that he is first and foremost an Habsburg. We can ourself learn from his love of Ukraine. A nation many see as a likely ally against the Russian Soviet bear."
AUShabsburg.17.a: "Welcome to Vienna"

AUShabsburg.18.t: "Wilhelm Franz Rejects the Call"
AUShabsburg.18.d: "A letter has been sent to us from Ukraine. It is signed by the Ukrainian Colonel, Wilhelm Franz, himself. Or even not him, but his Ukrainian alias Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. While he wishes us luck, he admits to not believe that the Empire can be restored. He sees himself no longer as an Habsburg, probably a feeling coming from his more rebellious side, but as Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. He signs of with two final words:\n\nSlava Ukraini!"
AUShabsburg.18.a: "Was Worth the Effort"

AUShabsburg.19.t: "Sibling Rivalry"
AUShabsburg.19.d: "The call of the Habsburg princes has undoubtly been answered by more than one set of siblings. One of these sets is Karl Albrecht and Wilhelm Franz. After a ceremony where they was restored to the ranks of officers in the Austrian Armed Forces, a discussion was to be heard between the two brothers. It resulted with the two of them being guided away by nearby guards to prevent further embarrassment.\n\nTheir discussion seems to be sparked by the debate of Galician sovereignty. While Karl Albrecht spoke up in favor of Polish supremacy, this ticked Wilhelm Franz off, who was persistent that the Ukrainian people there should be governed by Ukraine. For Otto, this debate is irrelevant. Galicia belonged to the Empire and it will belong to it again. That's what both of them signed up on."
AUShabsburg.19.a: "This is Ridiculous"

AUShabsburg.20.t: "Wilhelm Franz Leaves For Ukraine"
AUShabsburg.20.d: "The Ukrainians have seemingly followed in our steps, seeking to enthrone their own Habsburg. What this means, is that our dear Ukrainian Colonel, Wilhelm Franz, will leave Austria to his new kingdom in the east. As we wink farewell to Wilhelm Franz, we wink farewell to the new king of the Ukrainians: Vasyl I.\n\nLong Live King Vasyl I, Slava Ukraini!"
AUShabsburg.20.a: "Heroiam Slava!"

AUShabsburg.21.t: "Stjepan Sarkotić Retires"
AUShabsburg.21.d: "Stjepan Sarkotić have been a great help in lending his Great War expertice to the Austrian army and working within the Croatian émigré community in Vienna to better make Croatia ready for Habsburg rule. However, not everyone can live forever and Sarkotić have felt that his advanced age soon would force him into retirement. While he is still willing to advice the younger generations of generals and leaders in our realm, he will do it from the safety of retirement instead of on the field."
AUShabsburg.21.a: "Thank You For Your Service"

AUShabsburg.22.t: "A Proper Restoration"
AUShabsburg.22.d: "President Viktor Dankl von Krasnik has fulfilled his role the past couple of years. Under his presidency, Otto has been able to secure his position as a leader of the Austrian people. Under the guise of an early retirement due to his age, von Krasnik will step down as president. This will leave the room open for Otto to be elevated to the presidency by the now loyal parliament. However, his time as president will be short. In order to ensure the realm's continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the Austrian Kingdom, for a safe and secure society."
AUShabsburg.22.a: "A New Order, Born From the Old"

AUShabsburg.23.t: "Transylvania's Place in the Empire"
AUShabsburg.23.d: "When the Austro-Hungarian Empire was formed, Transylvania became a land directly ruled by the Hungarians. This, even though the majority of the region are mostly Romanians, with only a minority population of Hungarians mostly consentrated in what's known as Székely Land. Some in our movement decries the lack of representation that the old system gave to the Romanian people in our Empire. They want us to make Transylvania, or at least a sizeable part of it, separate from Hungary. However, this could also come to bite us later, as many Hungarians view Transylvania as their land, not wanting to separate from it."

### POLITICAL EVENTS ###

austria.15.t: "The Return to Normalcy"
austria.15.d: "Government intervention to save the economy was a hated measure by the Austrian School of Economics, however it came out quite fruitful. Normalcy is returning to Austria, especially after the reactivation of social welfare programs, the people are going back to their jobs and banks are reopening. The horrible days of Black Monday are behind us, and now we only need to catch up with the world."
austria.15.a: "An interesting economic experiment."

austria.16.t: "A New President of the National Council"
austria.16.d: "With the resignation of the last president of the Parliament, Karl Renner has risen to presidency of the National Council during a time of crisis. The "Democratic Revolution" created a parliamentary crisis. It is now the duty of the president unite the opposition before the crisis escalates."
austria.16.a: "Good luck, Karl."

austria.17.t: "Dollfuß Assumes Total Control of the Country"
austria.17.d: "Dollfuß and the nation had enough of the political bickering of the Nationalrat. He has taken command of the nation against the traitors of Vienna. Vienna is a city, while Austria is a country. Dollfuß has taken matters into his own hands and commanded the Heimwehr inside Vienna alongside the Heer. Now we only witness as the Nationalrat descends into chaos. In a swift motion, key parliament buildings are evacuated due to "emergency concerns" and closed down by Dollfuß."
austria.17.a: "There is a new father to the republic."

# austria.18 REMOVED FOR THIS RELEASE

austria.19.t: "The Assasination of Dolfuss"
austria.19.d: "After dissolving the parliament, forces from the Valkist militias in Vienna started to act. With their desire to takeover and unite Germany and Austria, a small group of Valkists stormed the Chancellery and demanded Dolfuss to leave the country and giveover control to the Valkist forces, when he denied the request, he was shot dead. The attempted coup wouldn't last though, as the Heimwehr and Bundesheer soon invaded the building and shot down the rebels. Schuschnigg and Rüdiger would meet and try to cooperate, to no avail as their differing thoughts got in the way. Now, the political battlefield is open to whoever can place their bids."
austria.19.a: "Let's see how this ends..."

austria.20.t: "The Negotiating Table"
austria.20.d: "After what seems like months of violence and internal struggle, the Heimwehr and Schuschnigg agreed to talks, however, another man has spoken for a consensus. Otto Von Habsburg has sent a letter to both Rüdiger and Schuschnigg, promoting the idea of him being a middle man, someone who can try and make amends between the parties - Schuschnigg and Rüdiger refused the invite, but Schuschnigg thanked the would be Emperor for trying.\nThe meeting between Rüdiger and Schuschnigg is soon to arrive, and the cards will be shown to both players."
austria.20.a: "Let's hope for peace at our time."

austria.23.t: "Schuschnigg Assumes the Chancellorship"
austria.23.d: "After the death of Dolfuss, Schuschnigg and Rüdiger have been in a political battle to see who will command Austria, but it finally seems like this is over. The political battlefield is now dominated by Schuschnigg and his loyal forces, with the Bundesheer taking over key points in Vienna and maintaining order, it seems that with the takeover, the Heimwehr has started to be absorbed by Schuschnigg and those who don't integrate are destroyed..."
austria.23.a: "Long live Austria!"

austria.24.t: "Negotiations Comes to a Stop"
austria.24.d: "The unwillingness of men like Schuschnigg and Rüdiger to come to an agreement shouldn't be surprising. At the negotiation table between the two, they began to bicker. Quickly, the situation turned, with both men leaving the table without any formal agreement. With the situation in Austria more dire than ever, it looks likely that violence would resume. A portion of the Bundesheer not loyal to either men, together with non-aligned militia groups have begun to plan out other alternatives."
austria.24.a: "Peace Seems to be Halting"

austria.25.t: "Otto's Gambit"
austria.25.d: "Otto von Habsburg hasn't been inactive during the negotiations between Schuschnigg and Rüdiger. Already, he is forming a circle of men who seek an alternative to the chaos that have held unto Austria since the death of Dollfuß. While an honourable man, some of Otto's loyalists have set forward a plan to end the chaos. The thing is, that it would involve a tiny accident at the Nationalrat just where the negotiations between Schuschnigg and Rüdiger have been taken place. Even if it is underhanded, it could be the only way to save Austria from the death spiral it's currently in."
austria.25.a: "Better Be Silent"

austria.26.t: "Negotiations Continues and Fails"
austria.26.d: "Yet another day, yet another failed negotiation, yet more Austrian blood spilled on the streets due to the egos of these men. The plan is ready. Otto has just to give the word..."
austria.26.a: "Explode the Nationalrat"
austria.26.b: "Wait, No!"

austria.27.t: "Otto's Triumph"
austria.27.d: "An explosion rocked the streets of Vienna this afternoon. It originated at the Nationalrat. The first moments after the explosion, shooting was heard as both Heimwehr and Bundesheer forces loyal to either Rüdiger or Schuschnigg quickly began a few skirmishes against each other, believing they were under attack. After a few hours, however, the situation became to calm down as they found out there were no more explosions coming. What they also found, was both Schuschnigg and Rüdiger dead under the rubble that fell down during the explosion.\n\nForces loyal to Otto von Habsburg quickly entered the scene, with many of the now leaderless soldiers joining ranks. An investigation into the explosion is soon to take place, and while we know what has really happened, the blame will ultimately be placed upon some radical communist lone wolfs.\n\nFor now, Austria needs to heal. It needs to find a new form of normalcy and stability. It needs a steady hand; It needs Otto von Habsburg."
austria.27.a: "The Habsburgs Are Back"

austria.31.t: "Landbund Requests Grants to Farmers"
austria.31.d: "As the crisis worsens, the Landbund has requested that we aid the small farmers with some subsides. Helping the farmers will hurt our budget a bit but the Landbund may leave if we don't concede."
austria.31.a: "We will concede."
austria.31.b: "We can't..."

austria.32.t: "The Heimwehr's Position"
austria.32.d: "With the death of Dollfuß, it seems that Austria is heading towards political turmoil. This is especially so because of the Heimwehr, which now acts as the main roadblock between Schuschnigg, the sucessor of Dollfuß's legacy and control of the Austrian state. Even if Schuschnigg for many Heimwehr leaders is far too moderate however, perhaps there is some merit in leaving things be and seeing how things pass by over the next month?"
austria.32.a: "The Heimwehr recedes into the background."
austria.32.b: "The Heimwehr shall fight vigorously!"
austria.32.tt: "In 30 days, the following event will trigger:"

austria.38.t: "$rhein.republic.23.t$"
austria.38.d: "Today, a delegation from Vienna of all places have come in, suggesting an alliance. $rhein.republic.23.d$"
austria.38.a: "We must come together!"
austria.38.b: "This is absurd!"

austria.39.t: "Koblenz Accepts!"
austria.39.d: "The Koblenz government has accepted our offer of alliance against the false German government! With this, we now officially recognize them as the legitimate German government, in contrast to the tyrants of Berlin and together we shall struggle until victory or death!"
austria.39.a: "Together against Berlin!"

austria.40.t: "Rhenish Folly"
austria.40.d: "In a truly unfortunate turn of events, our offer of friendship was rejected totally by the Koblenz government. It seems that we will have to fight for the future of our state without German brotherhood."
austria.40.a: "Not every German government can be trusted..."

austria.33.desc: "An ambassador from [FROM.GetNameDef] has approached [ROOT.GetLeader] with a proposal of a defensive pact between [FROM.GetNameDef] and [ROOT.GetNameDef]. This plan is being sold as a way to keep peace in the region, but some within [ROOT.GetRulingPartyLong] believe it will allow [ROOT.GetNameDef] to expand without us being able to intervene."

austria.36.desc: "Field Marshal Jansa from [FROM.GetNameDef] has proposed to expand Jansa's forts into [ROOT.GetNameDef] across the Sudetendland, to prevent [GER.GetNameDef] from invading our countries with ease. We would need to contribute a lot of industrial power to the plan, but [GER.GetAdjective] expansionism will lead to war eventually."

austria.37.desc: "Field Marshal Jansa has returned with bad news, [FROM.GetNameDef] will not contribute towards his plan of a fortification line in the Sudetenland."

AUS_burn_treaty_of_linz: "Burn the Treaty of Saint-Germain"
AUS_burn_treaty_of_linz_desc: "Under the current stipulations of the Saint-Germain treaty, we might as well head to Berlin pleading for mercy today. For Austria to be safe, free and proud, the Saint-Germain treaty cannot stand any longer."

AUS_reform_general_staff: "Reform the General Staff"
AUS_reform_general_staff_desc: "General staff reforms may not seem on the surface to be terribly important, but they are key to waging war efficiently and effectively. An effort to ensure that this branch of the military is modern will also herald a total modernization of the army."

AUS_modernize_theresian_military_academy: "Modernise the Theresian Military Academy"
AUS_modernize_theresian_military_academy_desc: "The Austrian military tradition is long, but the last two decades of technological development have left behind our strategies and plans in the dust. A modernization of the academy must begin to uphold Austria."

AUS_preserve_army_traditions: "Preserve Army Traditions"
AUS_preserve_army_traditions_desc: "We have a long, if not necessarily totally illustrious military history. Still, no one can deny who our forefathers were, and their victories, from Aspern-Essling to Caporetto. In these times where even the Austrian state’s future is uncertain, military traditions ought to be upheld."

AUS_eimannsberger_kampfwagenkrieg: "Eimannsberger’s Kampfwagenkrieg"
AUS_eimannsberger_kampfwagenkrieg_desc: "Despite what our northern neighbors might believe, Austrian theory still trumps their own. Despite the claims of their eminent radicals like Heinz Guderian, his work is clearly stolen from our very own Ludwig von Eimannsberger, whose theories on the deployment of armor in mobile warfare must be taken seriously."

AUS_support_local_tank_production: "Support Local Tank Production"
AUS_support_local_tank_production_desc: "Unfortunately like many of the poorer nations in Europe, the best that we can do in regards to armor production is to simply import and modify foreign-made tanks as we need. This is by no means a desirable situation however, and hence we should try to rectify it to the best of our ability."

AUS_expand_alpine_fortifications: "Expand Alpine Fortifications"
AUS_expand_alpine_fortifications_desc: "The Alps are hard to get passed through even in normal conditions, however, we are not in a position to bet on victory. The Germans will use anything and everything to destroy our defences, we need to reinforce every part of our country, and this includes the Alps."

AUS_armored_spearhead: "Armored Spearhead"
AUS_armored_spearhead_desc: "Austria may be a small nation, but small nations can clearly still punch above their weight as seen from Serbia in 1914. With recent developments into armor tactics pioneered by our generals, Austrian tanks shall soon be ready to smash through the enemy’s lines and achieve victory!"

AUS_mountain_artillery: "Integrate Mountain Artillery"
AUS_mountain_artillery_desc: "We will likely be facing our enemies in mountainous terrain, where regular artillery works rather dismally compared to usual. Thankfully, there is a remedy, that being mountain artillery which can be easily hauled up by our forces and capable of withstanding the tough conditions of the mountains."

AUS_expand_the_gebirgsjager: "Expand the Gebirgsjäger"
AUS_expand_the_gebirgsjager_desc: "Fighting at an altitude of more than quadruple digits weighs on the soul and requires a special set of skills. The Gebirgsjäger are our elite fighters in this theatre, a theatre we can expect to face plenty of combat in. As such, an expansion of this vaunted force is very much needed."

AUS_expand_logistic_capabilities: "Expand Logistical Capabilities"
AUS_expand_logistic_capabilities_desc: "No army can survive without food in their stomachs and shoes on their feet. Weapons too must be supplied to the troops if we are to even have hope in protecting our sovereignty, and to this we must endeavor to safeguard and expand our logistical efforts to ensure that all of Austria’s sons can fight as best they can."

AUS_motorize_the_heer: "Motorisation of the Heer"
AUS_motorize_the_heer_desc: "The era of the horse is over. While we may still extensively rely on horses for transportation, motorization is mandatory if the army is to modernize. We cannot be stuck walking on foot and waiting for supplies to reach while the enemy runs circles around us."

AUS_anti_tank_weaponry: "Implementation of Anti-Tank Weaponry"
AUS_anti_tank_weaponry_desc: "If there is a cheap way to counter the overwhelming strength of the panzers, it is anti-tank weaponry. Whether they are specialized pieces, grenades or even novel pieces of technology, any such item should be utilized for us to resist at low cost the enemy’s tanks."

AUS_modernize_equipment: "Modernise the Volksheer Equipment"
AUS_modernize_equipment_desc: "After the humiliating defeat in the Great War, the Austrian military remnants formed the Volksheer, this force is old, and frankly, a relic of the past. Buresch and other chancellors tried to improve the situation, but nothing much was achieved. However, now without the limitations of the past, we can finally start the modernisation of our equipment."

AUS_fund_military_innovations: "Fund Military Innovations"
AUS_fund_military_innovations_desc: "The old k.u.k. army always left something to be desired when it came to military technology. We still suffer from the general dearth of investment into military technology, which is vital if we are to somehow resist the menaces to Austrian freedom."

AUS_create_paratrooper_units: "Create Airborne Units"
AUS_create_paratrooper_units_desc: "Few could have dreamed of an era where soldiers would come not just from the ground or from sea, but from the air. The potential uses of airborne forces are so numerous that it may very well be a worthy investment even for us."

AUS_use_civillian_pilot_schools: "Use Civilian Pilot Schools"
AUS_use_civillian_pilot_schools_desc: "Our pilots need to learn how to fly, but this was unfortunately hindered by the strict stipulations of Saint-Germain. Luckily, there are many civilian pilot schools whose experts can help us in setting up an air force."

AUS_buy_planes_from_eastern_europe: "Buy Planes from Eastern Europe"
AUS_buy_planes_from_eastern_europe_desc: "Even if they are not the best of the best, we cannot be picky when it comes to what aircraft we can pick. The nations of Eastern Europe have indicated their willingness to sell us planes that we will need to control Austria’s skies."

AUS_build_brumowski_air_base: "Construct the Brumowski Air Base"
AUS_build_brumowski_air_base_desc: "For the air force to be of any use, there must be some sort of base that our pilots can take off from. Civilian runways and other hastily created structures just will not cut it anymore - a proper air base is needed."

AUS_produce_austrian_fighters: "Produce Austrian Fighters"
AUS_produce_austrian_fighters_desc: "LIke many foreign nations, much of our aircraft hails from abroad, designed or manufactured by potential future enemies of Austria. While this is mainly a matter of practical necessity, it too is a shameful legacy for one of the chief combatants in the Great War. Let us thus see to it that an Austrian fighter controls Austrian skies."

AUS_produce_austrian_bombers: "Produce Austrian Bombers"
AUS_produce_austrian_bombers_desc: "It may seem like a fantasy, but an Austrian bomber project could very well prove to be a decisive factor in the next war. All theory points towards the triumph of the bomber from the skies, and our enemies will certainly think twice if an armada of bombers is prepared to flatten their factories and terrorize their people."

AUS_adopt_dive_bomber_tactics: "Adopt Dive Bomber Tactics"
AUS_adopt_dive_bomber_tactics_desc: "Dive bombing is a risky manoeuvre to pull off in some ways, but it is one that results in devastating accuracy for the bomber. This will be crucial if we are to help our air force support the troops on the ground, who already stand outnumbered by many of our foes."

AUS_finish_air_defense_systems: "Finish the Austrian Air Defence System"
AUS_finish_air_defense_systems_desc: "While it is unfortunate, the truth is that we are very unlikely to hold any kind of air supremacy in our future wars, at least in the immediate future. An air defence system is hence vital if we are to resist the enemy’s efforts to terrorize our people into submission through bombing."

AUS_armed_forces_of_austria_modernized_and_united: "The Formation of the Bundesheer"
AUS_armed_forces_of_austria_modernized_and_united_desc: "We can be proud of how much the Austrian military, once little more than a parade force, can now stand as one of the bastions of freedom and dignity in Central Europe. Austria shall not falter, and freedom shall be protected!"

# INDUSTRIAL FOCUS

AUS_economic_recovery: "Towards Economic Recovery"
AUS_economic_recovery_desc: "The worst of the recent economic crisis has passed, and thus we ought to restart our efforts to recover some semblance of economic prosperity - lest we end up at the mercy of Germany."

AUS_fiscal_reforms: "Fiscal Reforms"
AUS_fiscal_reforms_desc: "Old spending habits have proven wasteful, while critically undervalued ventures remain unfunded. Our fiscal situation is in dire need of reform, and with the economic crash there is no time like the present for it."

AUS_dealing_with_equipment: "Dealing with Equipment"
AUS_dealing_with_equipment_desc: "Although our industrial base is lacking compared to the titans to our north and south, we still inherit the legacy of the extensive companies that equipped the armies of the Dual Monarchy. As such, we must be ready to deal with such matters - even if only to maintain their legacy."

AUS_fate_of_steyr: "Fate of Steyr-Daimler-Puch"
AUS_fate_of_steyr_desc: "Steyr-Daimler-Puch is one of the largest weapons manufacturers in Austria, and they are crucial in equipping all of our soldiers with armaments. However, it still remains out of our reach and hence we must decide if we are to simply cooperate closely with them or if we should take on a stronger role regarding them."

AUS_import_equipment: "Import Equipment"
AUS_import_equipment_desc: "We simply are unable to produce everything that we need when it comes to military equipment. Even if rifles and machine guns can be made here, boots, bandages and other essentials in modern war still must be imported, and hence we must do so post-haste."

AUS_national_contracts: "Contracts with Austrian Companies"
AUS_national_contracts_desc: "In these unstable times, only cooperation between government and private enterprise can see Austria through. While Austrian manufacturers may not be the largest in the world, their products are still vital to our survival and thus contracts for their weapons must be executed at once!"

AUS_nationalise_factories: "Nationalise Factories"
AUS_nationalise_factories_desc: "With hard times falling on all of Austria, many factories are beginning to go out of business. However, such a thing can only mean a further downward spiral into economic degeneration, with the only cure being nationalization of failing factories."

AUS_expand_frei_arbei: "Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst"
AUS_expand_frei_arbei_desc: "Under the laborious Saint-Germain Treaty, many young men became unable to join the army where their only prospects may have been laid. Now with the economic crisis, masses of sullen young workers are chafing under unemployment and threaten societal stability. The only remedy is a labor service to reinvigorate their spirit and the economy."

AUS_catholic_works: "Invest in Catholic Works"
AUS_catholic_works_desc: "Catholicism is one of the bedrock of the Austrian state, differentiating us greatly from our zealous German brothers from the north. Their good works include education, charity and other things that all come together to make them worthy of state investment, especially in these times of crisis."

AUS_bail_out_agriculture: "Bail Out Agriculture"

AUS_electrify: "Electrify the Country"
AUS_electrify_desc: "It is ironic that one of the former great powers of Europe has yet to electrify the nation, while our once weak neighbors speed ahead into the modern age. If we are to take on the true German way, we must ensure that both the city and countryside have at least electricity!"

AUS_empower_corporations: "Empower the Corporations"

AUS_reform_the_corporate_system: "Reform the Corporate System"
AUS_reform_the_corporate_system_desc: "The folly of large companies controlling the market has shown itself in an laughably cruel form in the London Stock Market crash. A wholesale reform of the system is needed to see the Austrian economy properly bounce back."

AUS_end_austerity: "End Austerity"

AUS_bundesbahn: "Expand the Bundesbahn"
AUS_bundesbahn_desc: "Railways are a crucial part of the economy, so it is obvious that some new investment into their development is necessary. An expansion of the Bundesbahn will help to bind Austrians closer together, and will provide much needed work for many."

AUS_expand_social_programs: "Expand Social Programs"
AUS_expand_social_programs_desc: "The most destitute in society do not deserve their miserable situation, and in any case they are better off receiving morsels from us instead of stealing them from innocents.

AUS_vienna_uni_investment: "Invest in the University of Vienna"
AUS_vienna_uni_investment_desc: "Austrian education shall build the Austria of tomorrow, instilling in all an Austrian identity rather than one bound to Berlin.

AUS_credianstalt: "Integrate the Creditanstalt"
AUS_credianstalt_desc: "The Creditanstalt crash of 1931 was one that crippled the economies of not just Austria, but of Germany too. With millions having found their savings wiped out, we have to ensure that such a thing never happens again. This can only be done through the integration of the Creditanstalt into the government."

AUS_expand_sudbahn: "Expand the Südbahn"
AUS_expand_sudbahn_desc: "Our connections with the rest of the world by rail remain rather small, hampering our ability to trade. Expanding the Südbahn into Slovenia will help to alleviate relations with our southern neighbor, as well as allowing us to connect further into the world economy."

AUS_expand_mines: "Expand Austrian Mines"
AUS_expand_mines_desc: "Even if we are not able to pursue full autarky, some self-sufficiency regarding natural resources is key for our development and national security. The mines of Austria still remain generally unexploited and are practically begging for some exploration and expansion for the nation’s gain."

AUS_steyr_expansion: "Expand the Steyr-Daimler-Puch"

AUS_favor_industry: "Favour Industrial Interests"
AUS_favor_industry_desc: "The sad reality is that agriculture is not viable for Austrians to pursue. The farmers must simply realize that Austria is not able to be self-sufficient in a diminished state, especially when the alternative is cheaper food for the people as a whole. Industrial interests are right - tariffs on food must be removed!"

AUS_protect_austrian_farmers: "Protect Austrian Farmers"
AUS_protect_austrian_farmers_desc: "Foreign agriculture is simply an un-Austrian import for the greedy capitalists of Vienna, Graz and Salzburg to satiate their endless consumption. We must protect the people of the land from the threat of foreign-made foods which in any case create a dependency on foreign peoples."

AUS_way_to_autarky: "On the Road to Autarky"
AUS_way_to_autarky_desc: "Autarky is not an undesirable objective, for it is a sign of an independent and strong nation as well as people. Through further agricultural development, we can ensure no Austrian shall ever go hungry again."

AUS_subjugate_czechia: "Liberate Sudeten Germans"

AUS_expand_the_jansas_plan_desc: "We now have the ability to build in Czech territory, which will let us work with Czechs in building a line that will be far too difficult for the Germans to crack - at least if they would like to keep their men from perishing pointlessly!"

AUS_send_an_attache_to_spain_desc: "The Spanish Civil War has turned out to be different from the Great War, with an emphasis on rapid movement and use of aircraft in coordination with armoured vehicles. It must be studied greatly. "

AUS_reclaim_tyrol: "Reclaim Tyrol"

AUS_vienna_accord: "The Vienna Accords"
AUS_vienna_accord_desc: "For all intents and purposes, the Entente are but the lesser of two highly devilish foes that we must face in the coming years. An alliance with them would be a disgrace to everything our forefathers fought for, not to mention that relying on them is plainly unreliable. Instead, we should reach out to the Koblenz government who like us also oppose the Valkist menace and stand together in the containment of Berlin."

AUS_join_entente: "Join the Entente"

AUS_reinforce_csp_at_burgenland_desc: "As their only truly cordial neighbor, the Hungarians have been awfully tight-lipped on the question of Burgenland by ultranationalist standards.

AUS_schuschnigg_for_independence: "The Father of the Nation"
AUS_schuschnigg_for_independence_desc: "Kurt Schuschnigg is not a mere tinpot dictator, but rather a guide for the new Austria. The Germans to the north desire to see Austria broken up into individual states that are to be made into Prussian dummies - and for this we shall not stand!"

AUS_new_nationalism: "Rejuvenate Austrian Nationalism"
AUS_new_nationalism_desc: "Austrian nationalism has been an unfortunately weak phenomenon ever since 1919, and often the most patriotic in our nation are not for Austria but rather for Germany!

AUS_revere_the_angels_desc: "We can’t let the people lose faith in democracy. We need to show them that this system can work, and to promote it for all Austrians. Let’s turn out pro-democratic propaganda, that will prop up both our movement, as well as other like-minded democrats in Austria."

AUS_attract_hungarian_refugees: "Attract Hungarian Refugees"
AUS_attract_hungarian_refugees_desc: "The revanchist dictatorship in Hungary has led to an exodus of dissidents from the country, many of whom are from the country’s German minority. We shall welcome them with open arms."

AUS_an_alliance_with_officers: "An Alliance with Officers"
AUS_an_alliance_with_officers_desc: "Many Austrian officers, both former and current ones, served under Habsburg rule during the Great War and see the return of the Habsburgs as a blessing. They have learned that the Republic means instability and chaos, and dream of the greatness of the Empire. By creating alliances with the officers and promoting Habsburg loyalists, we will create a strong ally in the army."

AUS_recall_stjepan_sarkotic: "Recall Stjepan Sarkotic"
AUS_recall_stjepan_sarkotic_desc: "Stjepan Sarkotić is an old, respected veteran from the Great War. One that many of our younger officers can learn a lot from. In addition, he is a central figure in the Croatian émigré community in Austria, and having him with us could prove useful in making the Croatians more happy with future Habsburg rule."

AUS_reforming_the_kuk: "Reforming the k.u.k"
AUS_reforming_the_kuk_desc: "The Imperial and Royal Army, also known as the Common Army, was the largest part of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces and a strong sign of our Empire’s former glory.

AUS_akademisches_corps_ottonen_desc: "The Akademisches Corps Ottonen has since the 1920s played an important role to counter the German nationalist tendencies in Austria, and to spread the values of a European Empire - a United Europe ruled by the Habsburgs. Increasingly, with the spread of Valkism and völkish sentiments, the Corps have become more inclusive to the Jewish community in Austria."

AUS_calling_all_princes: "Calling all Princes"
AUS_calling_all_princes_desc: "While many Habsburgs came back to Austria when Otto von Habsburg came to power, princes of the Habsburg family still live all over Europe. We need to send the call that they need to come back and serve the family, to serve the Empire yet again."

AUS_reform_royal_academies: "Reform Royal Academies"
AUS_reform_royal_academies_desc: "Imperial Austria was not a land foreign to learning and innovation. In fact, science and teachings should be a cornerstone of our new Empire. We should reform our institutions of learning, promoting education and blending these values with the ideals of monarchism and pan-European cooperation."

AUS_destroy_militias: "Destroy Militias"
AUS_destroy_militias_desc: "Militias are a blight on our beautiful nation. They are remnants of a dark time which linger on and haunt us every waking moment. While the violence on the streets has mostly died down, we can not allow for the monopoly of violence to be placed in the hands of some thugs. With changing times, there is no more room for boys playing war."

AUS_integrate_moderate_militiamen: "Integrate Moderate Militiamen"
AUS_integrate_moderate_militiamen_desc: "While many militiamen continue to be a blight on our beautiful nation, there are those willing to be reformed and integrated. While we need to bring down the worst of these thugs, some can prove to be useful in our armed forces. Let’s give some of them an opportunity to succeed, so they don’t return to these thuggish ways."

AUS_the_matter_of_loyalty: "The Matter of Loyalty"

AUS_a_strict_doctrine: "A Strict Doctrine"
AUS_a_strict_doctrine_desc: "The new k.u.k. is an army that is loyal to the crown and the people of Austria. They will not break and will not waste their time deviating over minute details. This way, we will be able to develop an army that can both stand against Germany and protect the Austrian realm."

AUS_basically_jansas_plan_but_with_resistance: "Plan a Doctrine of Resistance"
AUS_basically_jansas_plan_but_with_resistance_desc: "We must be ready for things to go south and for Germany to face us with overwhelming numerical superiority. What we however lack in numbers we have in spirit and brains, for the Germans are far more overextended than we are and hence we must be ready to force them to crack on fortress Austria!"

AUS_learning_from_the_isonzo: "Learnings from the Isonzo"
AUS_learning_from_the_isonzo_desc: "The Battles of the Isonzo was a costly experience for us - and we were not even the attackers!
