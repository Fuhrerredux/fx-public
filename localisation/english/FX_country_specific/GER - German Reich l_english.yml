#### History
GER_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The new Reich has arisen. It has been four years since Dressler's Valkists secured power following his victory in the presidential elections of 1932. The economy flounders no more while the German state stands prouder than it ever has since the old days of 1914.\n\nYet not all is well. The coalition that Dressler built is fraying and only concessions and empty promises have managed to alleviate the trouble that Germany faces internally. Furthermore, Germany still remains diminished with lost territories at every corner. Only time will tell if the dream of one people, one nation and one leader can truly hold."

GER_splash_title: "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer"
GER_splash_desc: "Since the catastrophic defeat in the Great War, Germany has seen a troublesome and tumultuous time. The old Wilhelmian order was broken beyond repair and replaced with a Republic, enforced by revolutionary forces. When the dust settled, it became clear to many that the fight over the heart of Germany had only just begun. The Rhineland was lost to French aligned separatists and the eastern lands to a new Polish state. To add insult to injury, large reparations were forced upon the young republic and the size of the army was severely limited. As a result, the ongoing economic hardships and humiliation only gave fuel to the flames of unrest and radicalism in Germany. It was during these times, that a new movement arose under the leadership of a war hero and veteran that would change the fate of Germany and the World.\n\nAfter the Great War, many socialist groups were formed in Germany and fought against the republican forces. The latter often had to rely on the \"Freikorps\" - voluntary units formed from demobilized war veterans, often with a far right and reactionary outlook. These Freikorps movements formed their own subculture within the young republic and became the militarized arm of the right-wing opposition not only to the socialists but also the republicans themselves.\n\nDressler himself would initially be one of the most vocal intellectual critics of the new republic but later join various Freikorps groups. After a failed coup, Dressler was arrested and used the time to write his most important book, Steel and Struggle which would outline the basis of much of his later work. After his time in prison, Dressler would become a unifying force for many of the Freikorps movements and found an intellectual vanguard for the political right. The Valkist movement was born.\n\nWhile Valkism grew under the skilled leadership of Dressler, so did the political strife and radicalism within the decaying republic. With the onset of the Great Depression, the republic would soon enter its death throes, culminating in Dressler’s victory at the polls in 1932. In spite of the anti-Valkist conspiracy at the highest echelons of government, Dressler would soon take his place as the Führer of Germany, overseeing a miraculous recovery from disgrace and humiliation.\n\nYet not all is well in the revived Reich. Once the golden child of the Valkist movement, the Trutzbündische Stoßtruppe have now radicalized from their marginalization during the coordination of society into a disgruntled völkisch force, seeking the opportunity to restore the Valkist revolution to a more \"pure\" state. On the other end of the coalition, the many extra-parliamentary clubs that have coalesced in the Young Conservative movement lead a tenuous alliance with the evermore disgruntled Young German Order who detest the seemingly more radical measures that the Führer takes - backed by a potent ally in the armed forces. Even if Germany is to be awoken and led towards her glorious destiny, who shall do it?"

GER_Adam_Dressler: "Adam Dressler"
GER_Adam_Dressler_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gJune 9th, 1895, in Karlsbad, Kingdom of Bohemia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gUnlike many of his comrades, Adam Dressler did not start as a fortunate intellectual in Germany. Rather, he spent his formative years in Bohemia, becoming exposed to the cruelties of life with the loss of his parents and subsequent departure to Germany where he would be raised by his uncle in Cologne. With the outbreak of the Great War however, the disaffected youth would seize the opportunity for heroism and glory for his people by joining the vaunted Heer. Serving in the bitter West, Dressler would begin to write a diary of his thoughts, serving with such distinction so as to win a Pour le Mérite and Iron Cross for his valor.\n\nEnding the war as a captain, the decorated officer would find himself discharged from the army and soon enough in the French occupied Rhineland. Furious at the futility of the war and the dictates of the liberal world order, Dressler would join his fellow comrades in a local Freikorps unit and soon run afoul of the occupation authorities for both passive and violent resistance. Evicted from his home in Cologne, Dressler would become a nationwide celebrity when his diary was published as \"Of Trenches and Heroes\" in 1920. Noted for his distinctly far-right views, Dressler would soon enter politics in concert with Hermann Ehrhardt, acting as the second-in-command in Organization Consul.\n\nAlas, this was not meant to be with Ehrhardt’s death at the hands of the republic in 1922. Taking charge of the organization’s remnants following its annihilation by the Weimar government, Dressler would soon form the basis for a Valkist movement. Inspired by fellow Sudeten-German Rudolf Jung, Dressler manoeuvred his way into preeminence, successfully striking an alliance with Reichswehr chief Hans von Seeckt and acting essentially as the dictator of Bavaria. Here, Dressler would begin to mature Valkism into an ideology beyond merely one wherein soldiers take precedence, with his realization that the Valkist movement ought to be one welded together not by material desires, but rather by the iron hammer of 'Weltanschauung'.\n\nNow Dressler stands on top, not merely a tool of the scheming Schleicher, nor in a ditch like the rest of the accursed leftists would like. For all of Germany has heard the Führer, and now the rest of the world will hear Germany.§!"

GER_Artur_Mahraun: "Artur Mahraun"
GER_Artur_Mahraun_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gDecember 30th, 1890, in Kassel, Province of Hanover, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gIn a path quite similar to many officers, Artur Mahraun would join the army following his graduation from high school in 1908, serving as an ensign and then lieutenant. Serving in the Great War with relative distinction, Mahraun would leave the military in defeat as a captain in 1920.\n\nHaving formed a company of nationalist veterans in Kassel the previous year, this Freikorps unit would act as the basis for the nascent Young German Order created after Mahraun’s discharge from the military. Positioning itself as desiring a synthesis of Potsdam and Weimar, Jungdo as it would grow to be known would soon become allied to the burgeoning Valkist movement in Bavaria, acting as a sort of north-western wing of the movement with strongholds in Hesse, Westfalen and Hanover. However, cooperation between the two was bumpy with heated conflicts over foreign policy and even a near defection of much of the movement in the face of what many feared was cooperation with the parties of the middle.\n\nNevertheless, the election of 1932 would see Grand Master Mahraun act as one of the most passionate campaigners for Dressler, with whom he shared a good relationship with. As the paramilitaries of Germany came out to advocate for Dressler and attack republican forces, Mahraun would find himself in the national spotlight as the apparent leader of the Young Conservatives of the Valkist movement.\n\nFollowing the treachery of the Red General, Mahraun and his Order would arise as the main paramilitary force behind the Young Conservative movement, otherwise stuck behind the Reichswehr’s indecision and the lack of teeth inherent in the conservative circles of the Reich. Greatly displeased at the ever-increasing revolutionary turn of Germany, Mahraun and Dressler’s relationship would soon cool to ice and many awaited the grand showdown between the two. Despite all expectations however, Mahraun would be the last one standing with Dressler now out of the way. Now unchallenged in the political field, it only remains to be seen how the Grand Master will bring about the synthesis of Weimar and Potsdam in the new Germany.§!"

GER_Hermann_Gauch: "Hermann Gauch"
GER_Hermann_Gauch_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 9th, 1899, in Einöllen, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gThe son of a farmer, Hermann Gauch would grow up to believe that his family’s impoverishment was due to the swindling of a Jewish merchant. Following his education in the midst of the Great War, Gauch would rush to volunteer for service in early 1917 and subsequently being injured and captured just over a year later in July 1918. Escaping in 1919, Gauch would train as a doctor as well as join the fledgling new Valkist movement in 1922.\n\nLeading a double life as a doctor and Valkist provocateur, Gauch would join the Stormtrooper movement in 1922, founding a local chapter in the occupied Rhineland. Gauch would soon gain infamy in his home region however for terrorist acts against the Entente occupation, fleeing imprisonment in 1924 after a failed assassination of Palatinate regionalist Heinz Orbis. Gauch would go on to spend his time writing, ideating a pre-Roman Saxon peasantry that shared collective ownership of the land. During this time, Gauch would become well-connected with many völkisch activists such as Walther Darré and Alfred Rosenberg, joining Darré in his campaigning for Dressler in the election of 1932.\n\nGauch’s best asset however in this period of struggle was none other than his relationship with the Führer himself. With Dressler taking a liking to Gauch’s anti-Christian views as well as general temperament, Gauch would find himself rapidly rising the ranks of the Valkist movement. Soon, Gauch would emerge from 1932 as one of the senior leaders of the Stormtroopers across the Reich.\n\nYet these good times were not to last, at least for the TST as Gauch saw it. Following the takeover, Dressler would begin to strip away much of the TST’s most qualified personnel, additionally stripping away vast funding and infrastructure and grafting it onto the state in cooperation with capital and conservatives. As the Valkist movement began to leave the peasantry behind, his once warm relationship with the Führer would sour significantly, with the final nail being his appointment as the overall Reichsführer-TST - a dying TST that is. In spite of all of this however, the Stormtroopers and Reichsführer Gauch have now found themselves at the top of the German nation - ready to ensure that the Valkist revolution and Germany at large shall be purified of all traitorous, Bolshevik and malevolent forces.§!"

GER_Ritter_von_Leeb_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gSeptember 5th, 1876, in Landsberg am Lech, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gIn 1895, Wilhelm Leeb joined the Bavarian Army as a flag cadet. Two years later, Leeb would be promoted to lieutenant and sent to China to put down the Boxer uprising. Subsequently, Leeb would attend the Bavarian War Academy, rising to the rank of senior lieutenant there in 1905. Leeb would then be assigned to the general staff after leaving the academy, working in the Bavarian general staff and then German general staff for two years each. In 1912, Leeb would be made captain, by which point he had returned to his old regiment and afterwards made battery commander. Just before the outbreak of the Great War, Leeb would be sent back to the general staff, serving there when war broke out. In 1915, Leeb would be made a first general staff officer, becoming Ritter von Leeb that same year for his achievements during the Gorlice-Tarnów offensive. In 1916, Leeb would be made major, the year after being assigned to the general staff of a Bavarian army group. Having ended the war with many awards and as senior quartermaster, Leeb would remain in the army and be sent to Berlin where he would be promoted to lieutenant colonel. Over the next few years, Leeb would serve in different staff capacities, rising to the rank of colonel in 1925 and being made regimental commander as such. In 1928, Leeb would be made artillery leader and subsequently major general the next year. At the end of 1929, Leeb would then rise to lieutenant general and then made commander of the Munich military district. With Dressler’s rise to power in 1932, Leeb would soon become commander-in-chief of the group command in Kassel and general of the artillery in 1934.§!\n\n§YNotes: In spite of his obvious sympathy towards the Young Conservative movement, Leeb’s loyalty to the Führer may be more than hoped by conspiratorial elements. Leeb is also a much more defensively-minded general than his peers, having written works advocating for Germany to take a more defensive posture in the next war."

GER_Gerd_von_Rundstedt: "Gerd von Rundstedt"
GER_Gerd_von_Rundstedt_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gDecember 12th, 1875, in Aschersleben, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gAs a scion of a military family, Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt was in many ways destined for a military career. Rundstedt enrolled at a cadet school in 1890, later graduating to become a cadet officer in 1892. Following another stint in a war school, Rundstedt would be promoted to second lieutenant in 1893, serving as a platoon leader and then adjutant. Having become lieutenant in 1899, Rundstedt would then be promoted to senior lieutenant as a regimental adjutant in 1902, relinquishing his command to study at the War Academy two years later. In 1907, Rundstedt would join the army general staff, soon rising to the rank of captain in 1909. At the outbreak of the Great War, Rundstedt served as a company commander, though he would quickly return to the general staff and serve in various such capacities throughout the war. By the war’s end, Rundstedt was a major, remaining in the now-feeble Reichswehr. Rundstedt would then begin serving as a general staff officer, first as first general staff officer and as divisional chief of staff. This would lead to his promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1920. In 1923, Rundstedt would attain the rank of colonel, becoming a regimental commander in 1925. His rise in the ranks would continue with his appointment as group command chief of staff, leading to his promotion to major general in 1927. Rundstedt would then be made a divisional commander the next year, becoming a lieutenant general in early 1929. In 1932, Rundstedt would be tasked with executing the Prussian Strike, overthrowing the social democratic government in Prussia. This would lead to Rundstedt finally being promoted to general of the infantry that year.§!\n\n§YNotes: Rundstedt is a firm Prussian conservative, meaning that his loyalties are both unquestionable and in doubt. Even if he has undeniable sympathies and ties with the Young Conservative movement, Prussian field marshals never mutiny, right?"

GER_Gunther_von_Kluge: "Günther von Kluge"
GER_Gunther_von_Kluge_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 30th, 1882, in Posen, Province of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gGünther von Kluge graduated from his cadet school and joined the Prussian Army as a lieutenant in 1901.

In 1912, Kluge would then join the general staff, rising to captain at the outbreak of the Great War. During the war, Kluge would serve in several staff positions, seeing action on both the Western and Eastern fronts as well as in Italy and eventually rising to divisional chief of staff in 1918. Following the war’s end, Kluge would remain in the army, initially serving as a divisional staff officer. In 1923, Kluge would be promoted to major and sent to the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin, serving in the training department. In 1926, Kluge would take a field command in a regiment, rising to lieutenant colonel as such the next year. In 1928, Kluge would rise to divisional chief of staff, being appointed colonel two years later in 1930. After further promotions to artillery regimental commander in 1930 and artillery leader in 1931, Kluge would then be promoted to major general in 1933 and then lieutenant general the next year following Dressler’s rise to power and the ensuing rapid remilitarization of Germany. Soon enough, Kluge would be granted command of an entire army corps, with his recent promotion to general of the artillery being yet another promotion that Kluge has earned.§!\n\n§YNotes: Nicknamed "Clever Hans" by his fellow officers, von Kluge has privately criticised the ultra-militarism Valkism holds dear.

Rising to senior lieutenant in 1915, Model would receive several major wounds throughout the course of the war, with his actions causing him to be recommended for general staff training in spite of his commander’s misgivings. In 1917, Model would be assigned to the general staff as an orderly officer, serving from the Western front to the Orient in several logistical capacities. At the end of the year, Model would be promoted to captain, seeing action until the end of the war. Following Germany’s defeat, Model would opt to remain in the army, serving as a company commander. Having been posted to several different staff positions until 1928, Model would be assigned to the training section of his division that year. Here, Model would serve as a lecturer in tactics and war studies as well as author a study on Gneisenau. In 1929, Model would be promoted to major, becoming an officer in the training department of the Troop Office. Model would then be sent on a secret visit to Russia, where he and other Reichswehr officers were allowed to study and train away from prying Entente eyes. By 1932, Model would reach the rank of lieutenant colonel, not long before he would be promoted again to colonel in 1934 following the rise of Dressler. With the expansion of the general staff, Model would then be assigned to head its technical department, with his talent leading to his continual promotion to field command.§!\n\n§YNotes: Having been recognized for his talent, Model is highly ambitious, which paired with his loyalty make him a dreaded foe for those who stand against the Valkist revolution."

GER_Friedrich_Paulus: "Friedrich Paulus"

Soon, Paulus would be sent to a war school which resulted in his promotion to lieutenant in 1911. Being made an adjutant in 1913, Paulus would see action at the start of the Great War in the west. Following a long illness that began in October 1914 and ended in 1915, Paulus would be made an orderly officer within a jäger regiment. Paulus would then be made senior lieutenant, seeing action as a staff officer for the rest of the war from Verdun to Macedonia. For his actions, Paulus would be awarded both classes of Iron Cross, rising to the rank of captain at war’s end. Paulus would then head east, serving within a Freikorps unit, albeit without seeing much direct action. Returning to the new, atrophied army following Germany’s defeat, Paulus became a regimental adjutant in 1920, becoming a staff officer of a group command in 1922 before soon being sent off to the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin the next year. Paulus would continue to serve as a staff officer in the ministry, being shuffled around staff positions until 1927, when he was made company chief within an infantry regiment. Having earned some renown for his talent, Paulus would be transferred to another staff position in 1930 before being sent back to Berlin the next year, being promoted to major as a result. Now serving in the training department, Paulus would serve as a tactics instructor and officer leader, rapidly being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1933 and then colonel in 1935 following Dressler’s rise to power. With the German military now expanding to unforeseen heights, Paulus has also risen the ranks, simply desiring an opportunity to prove himself.§!\n\n§YNotes: It is unknown as to what political views Paulus may hold, with many believing his opportunism may give way to the unthinkable - cooperation with communists."

Taking a course in the new technology of wireless communication, Guderian would switch to being a signals officer, all of this culminating in his attendance at the War Academy in 1913. At the start of the Great War, Guderian would change units, being promoted to senior lieutenant at the end of 1914. Serving as a signals officer until 1917 whereupon he would serve as a logistics officer in the general staff, Guderian would be promoted to captain at the end of 1915. After temporary dealings with Freikorps units, Guderian would remain in the army as a company chief. In 1922, Guderian would serve as an inspector of transportation units, joining a divisional staff two years later. Guderian would then be assigned a role as an instructor for secret general staff training, soon rising to the rank of major in 1927. In 1928, Guderian would be sent to the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin, where he continued to push for armor primacy, a concept that he had developed over the past years. Guderian would then be assigned further staff roles, serving as an inspector of motorized troops and rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1931 followed by colonel in 1933. Following Dressler’s rise to power, Guderian was granted command of Germany’s new panzer divisions as the preeminent head of the armor advocates in Germany.§!\n\n§YNotes: With an ambivalent view towards the Valkist movement, his Prussian convictions make his loyalty to the Führer clear. His work on the deployment and usage of armored units also bear a striking resemblance to those by Austrian officer Ludwig von Eimannsberger."

GER_Erwin_Rommel: "Erwin Rommel"
GER_Erwin_Rommel_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 15th, 1891, in Heidenheim an der Brenz, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gIn 1910, Erwin Rommel joined the Württemberg Army, being promoted to lieutenant in 1912 within his infantry regiment following his studies at the Danzig war academy. Rommel would then be assigned as a company officer within his regiment until 1914 where he would be transferred to a field artillery regiment. The outbreak of the Great War however would see Rommel back in his old regiment, serving with distinction and being awarded with an Iron Cross as a result. Following this, Rommel would be switched to a mountain fighter battalion, serving in Italy, Romania and on the Western Front. Here, Rommel would earn the Pour le Mérite for his actions and as a result be retained within the atrophied army. Initially, Rommel would serve as a company commander, being deployed against anti-government forces throughout the turbulent first years of the Republic. In 1924, Rommel would be assigned to a staff position at the battalion level, soon being moved to company chief within the same regiment. In spite of his performance however, Rommel failed the military district exam, being unable to enter the general staff. Nevertheless, Rommel would be made a teacher and inspector at the Dresden Infantry School, beginning his treatise on infantry tactics derived from his experience in the Great War. In April 1932, Rommel would be promoted to major, his last promotion before the rise of Dressler. Rommel would then be made the battalion commander in 1933, not long after being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935.§!\n\n§YNotes: Erwin Rommel has a close relationship with Adam Dressler, viewing him as the man destined to lead Germany back to her rightful place in the world. As such, he has been rapidly promoted and is likely to side with the Führer in any dispute."

At the outbreak of the Great War, Manstein would be switched to another guards regiment where he served as an adjutant. After recovering from a serious wound incurred on the Eastern Front, Manstein would be promoted to captain in 1915 and deployed on several staffs on both the Western and Eastern Front. In spite of Germany’s defeat, Manstein would remain in the shrunken Reichswehr, serving in the general staff of a group command. In 1921, Manstein was assigned to a battalion command, leaving that command in 1923 to take up one in the general staff of a division. His command in the general staff would then change to another division in 1925, where he served as the one of the officers responsible for leadership training. In 1927, Manstein would be promoted to major, serving in several more staff positions until he was deployed to the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin where he served as a departmental group leader in the Troop Office. In 1931, Manstein would be promoted to lieutenant colonel, being made a battalion commander in the process.

Kleist would then join a hussar regiment, becoming a captain just before the outbreak of war in 1914. When war broke out, Kleist would be placed in and serve in various staff capacities, first as a chief of a replacement squadron, then as the first general staff officer of the general command of an army corps and lastly as the first general staff officer of the guards cavalry division. At the war’s end, Kleist was retained in the Reichswehr, initially being assigned to a brigade staff and then to an infantry leader’s staff. In 1922, Kleist would be promoted to major, being transferred to a cavalry school to teach tactics the next year. Kleist would continue to serve as a cavalry officer, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1926. Kleist would then be made chief of staff of a cavalry division and then chief of staff of an infantry division in 1928 and 1929 respectively. In 1929, Kleist would be promoted to colonel, remaining as divisional chief of staff until 1931 when he would be made a regimental commander. In 1932, Kleist would be made a major general following his assignment as commander of a cavalry division, remaining so even after he was promoted to lieutenant general in 1933. With the recent expansion of the Reichsheer, Kleist has most recently been made an army corps commander.§!\n\n§YNotes: Ewald von Kleist is open about his monarchist sentiments and is strongly opposed to any harsh measures on the church, making him a prime sympathizer with the Young Conservative movement."

By October of that year, Witzleben would be promoted to captain, becoming a company commander within his new regiment. Here he would remain until 1917, when he was grievously wounded and sent to the general staff for training following his recovery. His last command would be as a first general staff officer of an infantry division, by which time he had earned several awards for his performance. As the hundred-thousand strong Reichswehr began to form, Witzleben would be switched between separate commands, winding up as a company commander in an infantry regiment. In 1922, Witzleben would be moved to a divisional staff and then the staff of an infantry leader in Potsdam, being promoted to major during this period.

Being promoted to senior lieutenant and having received both classes of Iron Cross by the war’s end, Germany’s defeat led to Steiner being discharged from the army. This was not for long however as Steiner would rejoin the Reichswehr when his Freikorps unit would be merged into the army. In 1927, Steiner would be promoted to captain, this being the last promotion he would receive in the Reichswehr as he was discharged in 1933. Steiner would then go on to fully join the Valkist German Bloc, becoming a member of the TST in the process. Due to his military background, Steiner would be assigned to work with the Head of Training at the TST in 1934, anonymously writing guidelines and instructions for the TST. In 1935, Steiner would become a military instructor in the TST, joining the TST disposition troops the same year. With the TST’s expansion as a military force, Steiner rose from TST-Obersturmbannführer to TST-Standartenführer, having been the commander of several TST battalions beforehand. §!\n\n§YNotes: One of the few Reichswehr officers in the TST faction, Felix Steiner has been deeply involved in the TST’s planned reform of the Reichswehr. Steiner’s vision for the army includes specially-trained assault regiments which would be trained as elite shock troops that would be selected for being highly athletic and fit instead of being well-educated."

Keppler would return as a lieutenant in 1914, just before the outbreak of the Great War. Keppler would serve in the war as a platoon and company commander, transferring to a different infantry brigade after receiving serious wounds early into the war. Keppler would continue to serve, this time as an orderly officer. In 1917, Keppler would be promoted to senior lieutenant, serving as a regimental adjutant from then on. By the war’s end, Keppler had earned several awards, being kept within the provisional Reichswehr. Nevertheless, Keppler left the army in 1919, opting to join a Freikorps group made up of soldiers from his now-dissolved regiment. This group would soon merge with the Hanover police, becoming a police captain and being a leader of a ‘Hunderschaft’ from 1924 to 1926. Keppler would then resign from the Prussian police in 1926 due to his personal and political disagreements with the force, switching to the Thuringian police force. Initially serving as a regular officer in Gotha, Keppler would become a police leader in Hildburghausen in 1927. The next year, Keppler would leave his position, continuing to serve as a consultant for the head of the Thuringia police in regards to organizational and operational matters. In 1930, Keppler joined the Valkist Fighters’ Front, also being promoted to police major the next year. Keppler would then be made commander of the Jena police department in 1933, serving as the Gotha police commander as well until 1935. That year, Keppler would be sent into the TST disposition troops, where he now serves as a commander and instructor.§!\n\n§YNotes: A former officer from the army, Georg Keppler is one of the most experienced commanders within the TST, though he has expressed doubts over the most radical elements of the TST."

Despite his age, Bach would quickly see action, being seriously wounded from a bullet in his shoulder and a gas attack in 1915 and 1918 respectively. By the war’s end, Bach would reach the rank of lieutenant. Following Germany’s defeat, Bach would serve in the Silesian Freikorps, receiving several awards for his actions. In 1919, Bach would return to the army, being commissioned as a lieutenant. However, Bach would be kicked out of the army in 1924 due to his Valkist sympathies, the same year he would join the Stahlhelm. Bach would go on to involve himself in several odd jobs to make a living, leading to him opening a successful taxi company in Berlin and running a farm in West Prussia. However, the Valkist wave would lead to Bach re-involving himself in politics, joining the VDF in 1930. Soon, Bach would become a member of the TST, the first of its kind in Landesberg where his farm was located. Here, Bach would organize the TST, soon being promoted to TST-Sturmbannführer in 1931 and then TST-Oberführer in 1932. That year, Bach would also become a member of the decrepit Reichstag, serving both there and in the field as one of the few TST leaders with military experience. From there on, Bach would serve as the leader of the TST sections in northeastern Germany, being promoted to TST-Brigadeführer in 1933. Most recently, Bach has been placed in-charge of the Königsberg police, making him key to any TST plot.§!\n\n§YNotes: A staunch member of the TST, he removed the 'Zelewski' part of his name following the takeover of 1932, with his force's hold in northeastern Germany placing it squarely into TST hands should the worst occur."

Demelhuber would then leave the army that year, initially working as a salesman after a short period of study in Munich. This wouldn’t be for long however as in 1921, Demelhuber would join the Bavarian police as a platoon leader, serving in this role as the republic continued to falter and give way to the Valkist movement. In the meanwhile, Demelhuber would rise the ranks, being made an adjutant to the Munich police chief in 1933. In 1935, Demelhuber would leave the police force, having in the meanwhile joined the TST and serving as a TST instructor.

Soon, Vahl would be sent to a cavalry regiment where he served as squadron chief. Eventually, Vahl would find himself among the first officers to serve in the newly-created Panzer divisions. With the rising influence of the TST within the Reich, Vahl would soon find a new home in the new army that the TST seeks to create - further eroding the influence of the old guard in the army.§!\n\n§YNotes: Vahl is one of the few officers that hailed from the Reichswehr, furthermore having trained in armor tactics and organization.

At the outbreak of war in 1914, Strachwitz would serve in the cavalry before quickly being captured on a patrol behind the enemy lines. Despite earning the Iron Cross for this, Strachwitz would remain in French captivity for the rest of the war in poor conditions. Following the war’s end, Strachwitz would return to Germany, getting married and seeing action in Silesia against Polish insurgents. Strachwitz would then reenter civilian life, working as an estate manager and landowner in Upper Silesia. Here, Strachwitz would experience success, meanwhile radicalizing towards valkism as the ineffectual republic continued to suffer. Joining the VDF in 1932, Strachwitz, who had served as a reserve officer since the mid-1920s, Strachwitz would become an officer in the TST troops, serving as a reserve captain in the army. Deeply intrigued by the new technology of the tank, Strachwitz would soon find himself among the first TST panzer troops.Now with Germany embroiled in war, Strachwitz rose the ranks, eventually achieving a field command - something that seemed far off just three decades ago.§!\n\n§YNotes: Whilst a devout Catholic and strongly aristocratic cavalry officer may not seem like the sort of person to join the TST, his bravado and energy, not to mention his strong anti-communist and anti-Polish sentiments have led Strachwitz to be tacitly accepted within the TST, although his odd mannerisms nevertheless make him stand out from the rest."

Once Germany’s defeat became certain, Eicke would leave the army and soon begin to thoroughly loathe the republic. Eicke would then proceed to find a way to make a living, dropping out of technical university just as soon as he joined in 1919 and trying and failing many times to become a member of the police. Having been notorious for his detestment of the new government, Eicke would fail to remain in the police and eventually gain work at BASF as a commercial employee. When BASF merged to form IG-Farben, Eicke would continue along in the new company, becoming a security commissioner by 1926. With the rise of the new Valkist movement, Eicke would soon join the rapidly growing movement with whom he shared much common interest. Eicke would right after become a TST member, quickly rising the ranks as one of the most effective - and brutal TST leaders around. Eicke would rise from to TST-Sturmführer to TST-Sturmbannführer and then TST-Standartenführer in 1931. Eicke would soon lose his job at IG-Farben due to his activities in the TST, finding himself in hot water several times for preparing to carry out terrorist activities. Returning from Yugoslavia following Dressler’s rise to power, Eicke would now find himself as TST-Brigadeführer, eventually being placed in-charge of the TST guard.

Having earned several awards for his service in the Baltics, Prieß would return to the shrunken army in Germany, serving in the cavalry as a sergeant. Whilst this would have been a rather uneventful career, with his retirement in 1931 to join the civil service seemingly marking the end of his military career; the rise of Dressler would change that.

After completing several different courses, Dönitz would be commissioned as a watch officer and adjutant on the ship Breslau. By 1913, Dönitz was promoted to lieutenant at sea. On the Breslau, Dönitz would be taken to Constantinople, seeing action in the Black Sea and receiving several awards for it. With his ship undergoing repairs, Dönitz would be sent off to Gallipoli in August 1915, serving as an observation officer and aviator. Recently promoted to first lieutenant at sea, Dönitz would return to Germany and join the new submarine branch of the Imperial Navy. Dönitz would then retrain to become a watch officer on U39, taking part in several combat missions. He would finally get his own ship to command in 1918, sinking several ships in the Mediterranean. However, Dönitz would be captured during one of his raids, becoming a prisoner of war.

In this role, Dönitz would demonstrate his abilities such that he was promoted to frigate captain in 1933, culminating in his assignment to rebuild the submarine arm of the fleet after Dressler’s rise and subsequent ignoring of Versailles.§!\n\n§YNotes: Believing that war with Britain is likely, Dönitz has called for more resources to be diverted to submarines, thinking it foolhardy for the German fleet to take on the Royal Navy without sufficient preparation."

Taking the naval officer examination in 1897, Raeder passed with flying colours, being appointed second lieutenant at sea. Initially serving as a signals officer on various cruisers, following which he was promoted to first lieutenant at sea in 1900, Raeder then took on several different shore and on-ship commands. In 1905, Raeder was promoted to captain lieutenant, becoming a consultant to the intelligence office of the Reichsmarineamt. In 1908, Raeder would become the navigation officer on both the ship Yorck and the imperial yacht Hohenzollern from 1910 to 1912. During this time, Raeder would become a corvette captain in 1911, leading to his appointment as the first admiral staff officer to the commander of Naval Reconnaissance Forces. Keeping his role at the start of the Great War, Raeder would continue to serve in his role over the course of the war, being promoted to frigate captain in 1917. Raeder was then shuffled away in 1918 to command the cruiser Cöln, afterwards being appointed as head of the central department of the Reichsmarineamt later that year. Whilst he kept his post during the "civil war", the Ehrhardt-Lüttwitz putsch of 1920 put Raeder’s loyalty into doubt due to his close connections with coup supporter Adolf von Trotha, leading to him being sent off to a minor post in the Naval Archives. After publishing a history on the tactical and operational capacities of the German naval forces during the Great War, Raeder would return to the spotlight as he was appointed the inspector of the naval education system. Soon, Raeder was made vice-admiral and chief of the Baltic Naval Station. Due to further political intrigue, Raeder was then propelled to the head of naval command in 1930, where he remained upon the ascendancy of Adam Dressler.§!\n\n§YNotes: Due to his upbringing, Raeder holds major sympathies with the Young Conservatives who he believes can help to keep the government moral and non-partisan."

### German-Hungarian events ###
gerhun.1.t: "Hungary wishes to join the Stahlpakt"
gerhun.1.d: "Relations with Hungary has been steadily increasing over the past few months, and they obviously wish to join us in European domination. Hungary would make a good Balkan ally, and allow us to secure the region indirectly. However, we will also have to come to their aid in any foolish wars they find themselves in."

### Ideas
GER_fraying_union: "Collapsing Will"

GER_a_reich_divided: "A Reich Divided"
GER_a_reich_divided_desc: "Despite Dressler being the Führer of the Reich and leader of the Valkist movement, the government and its institutions are still beset with factionalism. Out of necessity, the Valkists on their way to power had to compromise and work together with many similar thinking people. The big tent character of the Valkist movement therefore naturally leads to infighting that has to be addressed."

GER_was_ist_des_deutschen_vaterland: "Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?"
GER_was_ist_des_deutschen_vaterland_desc: "Our Reich was humiliated, occupied and mutilated by the Entente. Now many Germans live under the boot of foreign powers under foreign cultures, separated from their brethren and their Volk. We will fulfill the unification of all Germans under the Valkist movement, as a great destiny waits for every German. No matter if they live under the corrupt conservative bourgeois in Austria, the French tyrants in the Rhine or Polish barbarians, we will march against all enemies of the Reich."

GER_die_wacht_am_rhein: "Die Wacht am Rhein"
GER_die_wacht_am_rhein_desc: "The Rhineland, ever since German troops freed it from Napoleon's clutches, it was the pride of the Germans, the industrial heartland and the bulwark against the French. The Rhenish occupation is a humiliation that has to be rectified no matter the cost. Germany will once again throw back the French like our forefathers before us."

GER_clerical_spectre: "Kirchengespenst"
GER_clerical_spectre_desc: "There are many in Germany who believe in the Führer and in Germany's revival. Sadly, one such group that strongly disagrees is the wretched churches. Their basic tenants of kindness and mercy weaken the spirit and stand in the way of Germany's greatness. Speaking resolutely against any sort of Valkist revolution, many in the Church view us with suspicion and thus we must work additionally hard to ensure that they do not handicap us."
GER_clerical_spectre_2_desc: "There are many in Germany who believe in the Führer and in Germany's revival. Sadly, one such group that strongly disagrees is the wretched churches. Their basic tenants of kindness and mercy weaken the spirit and stand in the way of Germany's greatness. Speaking resolutely against any sort of Valkist revolution, many in the Church viewed us with suspicion, forcing us to work additionally hard to ensure that they do not handicap us.\n\nWith the onset of the [GetMechanicName], the Churches have resolutely stood against them - forcing us to quickly deal with them lest our revolution dies in the cradle."

Opposed to any sort of social revolution, a good majority of the aristocratic upper echelons of the Reichswehr have become firmly even more unsympathetic to our rule. To do away with this, we must convince them or rid them from the military altogether.\n\nTo decrease the effects of this spirit, the total number of generals with the trait §YHidden Sympathies§! must be decreased.

### Focuses
# Air Force
GER_expand_the_luftwaffe: "Expand the Luftwaffe"
GER_expand_the_luftwaffe_desc: "The Luftwaffe is our youngest army branch after the Entente dismantled our air force in the treaty of Versailles. Therefore we need to make sure that we expand it into a formidable fighting force on par with the Great Powers. The foundations were already laid in the days of the Republic but now we have all the resources we need to truly rule the Skies."

GER_engine_innovations: "Engine Innovations"
GER_engine_innovations_desc: "The Engine is the heart of every warmachine and German ingenuity will see that we are able to only field the most modern and powerful technology possible. The current Engines we use leak the power and efficiency needed for our total mobilization. We will begin a competition for the many big engineering companies to develop a new engine block for our larger projects."

GER_next_gen_fighters: "Next Generation Fighters"
GER_next_gen_fighters_desc: "In order to make sure our fighters are nothing but the very best and help us secure many victories in the air, we must take steps towards researching more and more next generation planes, to make sure the Luftwaffe will soon rule the skies!"

GER_heavy_fighter_programme: "Heavy Fighter Program"
GER_heavy_fighter_programme_desc: "As a result of the Bombergruppen doctrine, the demands on the range of operations have multiplied. Theorists and researchers are demanding new aircraft models to keep up with their increasingly aggressive bombardment plans. After the Paris bomber comes the London bomber, after that the Moscow bomber - and there doesn't seem to be an end!"

GER_jet_bomber_research: "Jet Bomber Research"
GER_jet_bomber_research_desc: "Ernst Heinkel's company, Heinkel Flugzeugwerke, has proposed plans for a hypothetical jet-powered aircraft. This type of aircraft would completely outclass all traditional combustion engine based fighters currently in use. Heinkel has suggested that with more funding, production on these planes could commence within the near future."

GER_expand_the_flugschulen: "Expand the Flugschulen"
GER_expand_the_flugschulen_desc: "A large professional air force will need trained Pilots. It is important that we give our eager youth the opportunity to join the ranks of this army branch and secure a steady stream of young and well educated personnel. The state will make sure that we support this endeavor whatever it may take to pursue our goals of total militarization."

GER_found_the_luftlandetruppe: "Found the Luftlandetruppe"
GER_found_the_luftlandetruppe_desc: "Due to our continuing focus on ground-air cooperation, there have been proposals of greatly expanding our Paratrooper division, which is currently in its infancy. This might have to do something with the fact that jumping from a flying plane does not seem very glorious or entertaining - or survivable, really. We should promote the image of the paratrooper as the spearhead of the Fuhrer's military."

GER_refurbish_airbases: "Refurbish Airbases"
GER_refurbish_airbases_desc: "Build airbases both in the Heimat and outer provinces so that we can set the infrastructure for better defence and offence in the skies."

GER_experimental_rocketry: "Experimental Rocketry"
GER_experimental_rocketry_desc: "German engineer, Wernher von Braun, has drafted design documents for a rocket-propelled autonomous weapon. These ballistic missiles would be cheap to build, require no crew to operate and cause significant damage to enemy infrastructure. Braun only needs more technical support to get these weapons in production."

GER_air_to_air_missles: "Air to Air Missles"
GER_air_to_air_missles_desc: "As the threat of the Second Weltkrieg looms, our enemies will attempt to destroy our industry though bombing campiagns. To help defend against this we should focus on producing more Anti-Air Defenses for our cities."

GER_naval_bomber_programs: "Naval Bomber Programs"
GER_naval_bomber_programs_desc: "Another result of the untangling of air warfare from ground warfare has been the founding of a group of aviators focused on naval aviation. These pilots, trained in special courses, are now demanding aircraft to fit their special requirements."

GER_coordinated_air_support: "Coordinated Air Support"
GER_coordinated_air_support_desc: "The requirements and possible uses of close air support aircraft have proven to be far different from those of more mainstream fighter aircraft. If we concentrate our air research capabilities on identifying and exploiting the intricacies of this specialised form of air warfare, we should be able to achieve far better results in aircraft manufacturing."

GER_long_range_bomber_programme: "Long Range Bomber"
GER_long_range_bomber_programme_desc: "To augment our war efforts, we will need bombers that can fly longer missions and strike deep behind enemy lines to disrupt supplies and weaken the morale of the enemy population. Our current bombers are not sufficiently equipped to perform these kinds of missions. Instead we will commission a new strategic bomber which will increase our tactical range tremendously."

GER_carrier_fighters: "Carrier Fighters"
GER_carrier_fighters_desc: "Aircraft carriers are a fine tool of war which allows us a kind of flexibility not known before. However a carrier is useless without a proper fighter force. It is necessary that we further develop techniques and tools but also new dedicated aircraft, adapted to takeoffs from ship decks. Our best engineers will be tasked with this important order."

# Navy
GER_pride_of_the_kriegsmarine: "Pride of the Reichsmarine"
GER_pride_of_the_kriegsmarine_desc: "Manövergruppen requires new carriers. We shall construct these stalwart new additions to our Grand Fleet at once."
GER_pride_of_the_kriegsmarine_variant_tt: "§PYou will receive carrier variant based on your highest researched carrier technology.§!"
GER_pride_of_the_kriegsmarine_production_tt: "\nAdd a production line of §YGraf Zeppelin Class§! carrier with §G40% progress§!."

GER_revive_the_kriegsmarine: "Revive the Reichsmarine"
GER_revive_the_kriegsmarine_desc: "The war with France has pushed our navy harder than ever before. We must continue developing our ships to counter any advancements the French try to make."

GER_expand_sub_efforts: "Expand Submarine Efforts"
GER_expand_sub_efforts_desc: "Karl Dönitz leads a vocal faction within the Reichsmarine that believes that Germany will not be ready to directly engage with the other naval powers by the time another conflict may break out. Dönitz instead suggests that Germany should take an indirect approach to naval warfare, striking at enemy shipping and avoiding direct action with other combat-capable ships."

GER_rebuild_high_seas_fleet: "Rebuild the High Seas Fleet"
GER_rebuild_high_seas_fleet_desc: "German industry is some of the most well developed in the world. Some of the most impressive instruments of war have been developed within our borders. With this in mind, Admiral Erich Raeder has drafted plans for powerful battleships, larger and more armed than anything currently produced by Britain or France. With ships like this as the core of our navy no nation will be able to compete with our sheer overwhelming firepower."

GER_new_destroyers: "New Destroyers"
GER_new_destroyers_desc: "The Destroyers are the might of our navy and we shall greatly expand their roles in our fleets. In the light of our current rearmament efforts, a modern easy to produce and powerful model is required that improves upon the outdated designs we currently field. This new Navy will finally bring the seas under our control."

GER_type_xxi_submarine: "Type XXI Submarine"
GER_type_xxi_submarine_desc: "We learned from the Great War how valuable submarines can be, but also their weaknesses. This new class of submarines is mainly powered by an electrical engine and designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than spending most of their time as surface ships. It is silent and fast underwater but leaks in surface speed. We already built two prototypes but a full commission still needs our approval and will take some time to begin production given the complexity of the design, which was criticized by some."
GER_increase_submarine_production: "Increase Submarine Production"
GER_increase_submarine_production_desc: "With our naval capabilities being rather limited compared to the great naval powers, we will have to find non-conventional ways to dominate the waves. To this end, submarines will be one of the keys to winning the war at sea and as such their output must be drastically improved."

GER_build_nordstern: "Build Nordstern"
GER_build_nordstern_desc: "With Norway now in our hands, we can finally begin a plan that has long enamored the Führer. An architectural project of massive proportions, a new city is to be built that will be to the North Atlantic what Singapore is to Southeast Asia. Acting as both a base for the Kreigsmarine and as a new city for a new Germany, we can finally get to work."

GER_expand_wilhelmshaven: "Expand Wilhelmshaven"
GER_expand_wilhelmshaven_desc: "We require an expanded port for basing for both our submarines and our larger fleets. Investing into the crucial Reichsmarine base at Wilhelmshaven is a good start for accomplishing this."

GER_cruiser_improvements: "Cruiser Improvements"
GER_cruiser_improvements_desc: "Cruisers, both light and heavy, make up the backbone of our naval forces. We must modernise our cruisers at once in order to stay competitive."

GER_mines_and_coastal_batteries: "Mine Warfare and Torpedoes"
GER_mines_and_coastal_batteries_desc: "A ship cannot avoid what they cannot see. We shall invest in newer, more powerful and stealthy torpedoes to strike the enemy."

GER_intensify_naval_research: "Intensify Naval Research"
GER_intensify_naval_research_desc: "Naval technology is rapidly advancing in today’s world. With the dreadnoughts and battleships of old now being replaced with faster, harder-hitting ships as well as the new aircraft carrier, we must also invest into this research, ensuring that we will at least not be hopelessly behind once we have dominated Europe."

GER_new_torpedo_designs: "New Torpedo Designs"
GER_new_torpedo_designs_desc: "Although the Reich’s current naval capacity leaves much to be desired, that does not mean we should simply neglect the formerly-glorious navy. To this end, investments into new designs for torpedoes, which are especially necessary for their ability to hit hard at a cheaper cost than usual, is necessary to ensure that we can at least hold our own at sea."

GER_new_battleships: "New Battleships"
GER_new_battleships_desc: "Once upon a time, Germany had a glorious fleet. A fleet that could match up to even the Royal Navy. A fleet that made every German proud. Yet, the dismantlement of the High Seas Fleet has not cowed the German naval spirit. The key to any fleet is the battleship and as such we ought to further invest into battleship construction."

GER_advanced_screening_tech: "Advanced Screening Technology"
GER_advanced_screening_tech_desc: "If there’s one thing the Reich will not forgive the Tommies for, it will be the cruel blockade that forced Germany into submission. Considering the high likelihood that we will not be at peace with London for much longer, we must invest into the destroyers and cruisers that will alleviate the consequences of a blockade."

GER_hamburg_port_expansion: "Hamburg Port Expansion"
GER_hamburg_port_expansion_desc: "Now that Hamburg is reunited with Germany we must repair decades of damage caused by the failed Kiel government. While this has slowed down our naval rearmament plans it also gives us an opportunity to develop more modern and specialized facilities to speed up future ship production."

GER_independent_seebataillons: "Independent Seebataillons"
GER_independent_seebataillons_desc: "We must retrain and expand our marine corps to meet new challenges against enemies overseas. Granting them increased autonomy within naval command should give us better results."

GER_merchant_marine: "Enlarge the Merchant Marine"
GER_merchant_marine_desc: "Not every ship in a navy needs to be battle-ready. Transport ships and convoys that fuel the economy and our troops are also of the utmost importance and we cannot afford to be left behind when it comes to transport ships before it is too late."
# Army
GER_new_heer: "Review the Heer"
GER_new_heer_desc: "There is no institution in the Reich quite as vaunted as the Heer. Betrayed in the Great War, our soldiers have never failed to protect Germany from foreign threats. With war on the horizon, let us ensure that the Landser will never again be betrayed by civilian weakness!"

GER_never_another_stellungskrieg: "Never Another Stellungskrieg"
GER_never_another_stellungskrieg_desc: "We cannot hope to win another Stellungskrieg, not when the weight of Anglo-Saxon finance and wannabe Bonapartes desire Germany's enslavement. Hence, we must utilize all innovations gained from the Great War, from tanks to airplanes. The next war shall be the new Bewegungskrieg that we will fight."

GER_develop_new_infantry_weapons: "Fund Small Arms Research"
GER_develop_new_infantry_weapons_desc: "In order to properly modernize our army with new technology, we need to dedicate more resources into learning how to make the latest weapons and research how to do so, so we can build a properly equipped modern army."

GER_the_new_weapon: "The New Weapon"
GER_the_new_weapon_desc: "As compared to other weapons, the tank is one of the most recent developments in the art of war. However, this weapon has the capability to grant us the mobility so necessary for our victory against the numerically and materially stronger cabal of anti-German powers. All investments into this new weapon is as such warranted!"

GER_firepower_improvements: "Invest in Artillery"
GER_firepower_improvements_desc: "An area in which the German army has a longstanding tradition of lagging behind in the area of light support artillery. While the successes in building huge, unwieldy and impractical prestige objects such as the 'Paris Gun' can't be doubted, it's time to invest in some of the more practical - and more efficient - alternatives."

GER_accelerate_motorization: "Accelerate Motorization"
GER_accelerate_motorization_desc: "For much of human history, the infantry have traditionally lagged behind the cavalry. This has led to a devestating effect on our ability to manoeuvre; a dire state of affairs if left undealt with. Whilst we have been rearming faster than ever to reverse this state of affairs, we still have not been successful in achieving full motorization; something we shall now rectify."

GER_develop_rocket_artillery: "Develop Rocket Artillery"
GER_develop_rocket_artillery_desc: "Direct hit from artillery is destructive and deadly, but sometimes it's not enough to suppress enemy position or breakthrough. For this exact purpose, rocket artillery was created. Picture what happens in the enemy's mind when they're bombarded with an unstoppable rain of steel arrows while hiding deep in the trenches and what happens to them physically, well, this topic needs no picturing."

GER_build_spg: "Mobile Artillery"
GER_build_spg_desc: "As the Queen of the Battlefield, artillery has nevertheless historically proven to be rather difficult for the mobile Heer to effectively utilize. With new technologies however, we will now be able to inflict devestating damage upon the enemy with our far more mobile artillery units, who will prove crucial in the breakthroughs to come."
GER_get_spgs: "§YWe will develop a Self-Propelled Gun, depending on our level of armour research.§!"
GER_get_tds: "§YWe will develop a Tank Destroyer, depending on our level of armour research.§!"

GER_mechanize_infantry: "Mechanize the Infantry"
GER_mechanize_infantry_desc: "As the wars of the future begin to prove less and less like the first Great War, we must continue to hold our military edge. The development of new mechanized vehicles will allow our infantry to remain protected and mobile, enabling the Bewegungskrieg to continue onwards."

GER_promote_manoeuvre_warfare: "Promote Manoeuvre Warfare"
GER_promote_manoeuvre_warfare_desc: "Despite what some Frenchmen may think, we have the right formula for victory on the battlefield. Like Frederick before us, Germany stands mostly friendless and surrounded by devious foes. To stand triumphant, our wars must be quick and lively - and our army will ensure this is the case."

GER_expand_war_academies: "Expand the War Academies"
GER_expand_war_academies_desc: "As the Heer continues to expand, so does the number of new officers we need. As such, we must continue to expand the few schools across the Reich dedicated to the training of the officers who will lead the new Heer."

GER_kampfgruppe: "Encourage Kampfgruppe Formations"
GER_kampfgruppe_desc: "The war situation can change at anytime and with the creation of mass armies, the Heer must be prepared to be as flexible as can be. As an ad-hoc formation that is able to quickly react to battlefield developments, the Kampfgruppe will prove useful and as such must be spread across the entire Heer."

GER_enhance_enigma: "Enhance Enigma's Capabilities"
GER_enhance_enigma_desc: "Developed by one of Germany's brightest minds at the end of the Great War, the Enigma machine has been improved over the course of the republic and now-Reich. As an encryption tool, this machine has already proven worthy for the Reich and is deserving of improvements to render our communications impenetrable to enemy eyes."
GER_enigma_machine_tt: "§YIf an enemy decrypts our cipher and activates their its bonuses against us, this idea will be §Rlost§!!§!"

GER_develop_communications: "Spread the Radio"
GER_develop_communications_desc: "If we want to keep the battlefield moving, the troops must be able to learn of recent developments. With the development of the radio and other similar technologies, Bewegungskrieg has now gained even more lethal potential as the troops will now be able to communicate. Only through the spread of this technology can we hope to win the next war."

GER_anti_tank_measures: "Anti-Tank Measures"
GER_anti_tank_measures_desc: "As we continue our quest towards Germany's revival, our enemies will undoubtedly begin to amass a greater and greater horde of tanks. Should we leave our non-armoured units unprepared for this, disaster will surely arise. As such, tank destroyers and anti-tank guns must be developed to counteract this."

# Rearmament
GER_continue_rearmament: "Continue Rearmament"
GER_continue_rearmament_desc: "Despite our wishes, it is still too early to strike down the Parisian dogs once and for all. In a cowardly move, the French disarmed our brave, undefeated army with the help of domestic traitors. Although we have made efforts to reverse this sad state of affairs, we cannot squander the time we still have. Only through continued militarization and rearmament can we truly bring Germany back from the brink of oblivion."

GER_build_the_westwall: "Build the Westwall"
GER_build_the_westwall_desc: "During the Great War, one of our great defeats came from when we were pushed back from the Rhineland, and eventually beaten. We must construct adequate borders to make sure if things go sour, we have capable defenses, in which we could regroup."

GER_build_the_ostwall: "Build the Ostwall"
GER_build_the_ostwall_desc: "In light of our successes in the East, it is crucial to secure our positions and be prepared for any potential shift in the tide of battle. To bolster our defenses, we ought to construct a formidable line of fortifications, the Barbarossa Line, spanning from the Black Sea to the Baltic region."

GER_atlantik_wall: "Create the Atlantikwall"

GER_create_the_alpenfestung: "Create the Alpenfestung"
GER_create_the_alpenfestung_desc: "It is clear that our war effort is collapsing. Our enemies have marched into our nation and our ability to resist continues to diminish. A final stand for our nation has been drafted in which we will use what is left of our industry to build up defenses in the Alps and Sudeten mountians. From there we will make a valient last stand and make our enemies bleed for every inch of our territory."

GER_strategic_autarky: "Achieve Strategic Self-Sufficiency"
GER_strategic_autarky_desc: "In order to fund our re-conquest of our rightful territories, defeat the Entente, and stand up to the Soviet menace, we must create an economy that is free from the machinations of international finance capital. If we are to end up at war with the entire world, we better be ready to wage such a war!"

GER_embrace_synthetic_production: "Embrace Synthetic Production"
GER_embrace_synthetic_production_desc: "Germany lacks many natural resources, most crucial being rubber and oil. Whilst short-sighted governments may simply hope to stockpile enough resources for their war, German ingenuity once again proves this unnecessary. With the finest synthetic technology in Europe, we will be able to turn Germany into a self-sufficient state, not dependent on Anglo-Saxon rubber and oil."

GER_renew_state_arsenals: "Rejuvenate State Arsenals"
GER_renew_state_arsenals_desc: "While the German army has the greatest soldiers in the world, it must not lag behind in equipment terms. Even the greatest of soldiers will have a hard time defeating a better-equipped enemy and it would not do for the brave soldiers to be armed with broomsticks."

GER_work_battalions: "Work Battalions"
GER_work_battalions_desc: "There are many military age males in the Reich, but not all meet the requirements to be placed in frontline units. Placing them in labour battalions would not only descrease unemployment but greatly speed up construction projects."

GER_enhance_logistical_capabilities: "Improve Logistical Capacity"
GER_enhance_logistical_capabilities_desc: "With another great European war on the horizon, we must prepare for the possibility that not all nations see as we do. As the Bolsheviks begin to build themselves back up and the Anglos turn towards Europe, we must prepare for the possibility of war stretching from the gates of Moscow to the Tower of London. To win these battles, further investments into logistics must be made!"

GER_create_adrw: "Create the ADRW"
GER_create_adrw_desc: "We cannot allow corrupt capitalists and ineffective bureaucrats to gather the raw resources the Reich needs for Germany's resurrection. We will form the Amts für Deutsche Roh- und Werkstoffe, a military office that will ensure only the true and loyal soldiers of the Reich will handle such delicate affairs."

GER_utilize_lufthansa_connections: "Utilize Lufthansa Connections"
GER_utilize_lufthansa_connections_desc: "It has become self-evident that the wars that Germany must fight will require the German pilot to ascend both in spirit and in skill. However, our relative small size compared to the titans in London and Washington has created concerns that aircraft production may not meet demand. To this end, we shall work with Lufthansa in the production of more aircraft."

GER_streamline_weapons_production: "Streamline Weapons Production"
GER_streamline_weapons_production_desc: "Even if we would like to ensure that the best possible weapons reach the German soldier, this cannot be guaranteed, especially not under war-time conditions. With our foes growing their industries even larger and larger, Germany must compensate by streamlining our production to achieve maximum efficiency."

GER_use_foreign_labourers: "Use Foreign Labourers"
GER_use_foreign_labourers_desc: "As we wage our war of liberation against the shackles of Anglo-Saxon capitalism and Bolshevism, we have inevitably faced a labour shortage at home. However, our newly conquered territories and foreign allies have proven able to fill the gap in our production, at least in the short term."
GER_use_foreign_labourers_tt: "§gWe will be able to use foreign labourers from other countries that are subservient to us; granting us the following bonus:§!"

GER_mobilize_reich: "Mobilize the Reich"
GER_mobilize_reich_desc: "Every man, woman and child within Germany is directly responsible for the victory of the Fatherland and its troops. Every factory, every car and every truck needs to support the war effort. We will need military discipline and iron will to do what we need to for our future. Every resource we can offer, every bit of iron we can melt down will see its purpose on the front line. Only then can the war be won."

# Valkist Army 
GER_sword_shield_reich: "The Reich's Sword and Shield"
GER_sword_shield_reich_desc: "For too long, Germany has been enslaved to the naive notions of winning a war through simplistic and outdated methods and manners. The Heer's greatest task in its history now lies before it, and only through the Valkist spirit can we hope to triumph in the Hour of Destiny."

GER_valkist_indoctrination: "Valkist Indoctrination"
GER_valkist_indoctrination_desc: "As is the German way, faith in victory and unyielding spirit will see the German soldier through the most bitter of fighting. The Valkist ideal is our ideal soldier and thus we must ensure all soldiers are loyal only to the Fatherland and Valkism."

GER_warfare_without_restraint: "Warfare Without Restraint"
GER_warfare_without_restraint_desc: "Peace and mercy are weaknesses on the battlefield. Our failure to capitalize on the most brutal weapons in the first war led to our defeat by numerically stronger enemies. The only thing that matters on the battlefield is victory - something that will be achieved by any means necessary."

GER_create_werwolfe: "Create the Werwölfe"
GER_create_werwolfe_desc: "Whilst Germany is destined for inevitable greatness, our strategic position may lead to some bumps along this road. To this end, we must prepare for the enemy to successfully invade and ravage our land and people. The Werewolves will to this end harass the invaders, buying us time to strike back."
GER_the_werwolfe: "§YWe will receive decisions to set up and bolster §GWerwolf§! cells that can be activated once the enemy arrives.§!"

GER_secure_military_loyalty: "Earn Military Loyalty"
GER_secure_military_loyalty_desc: "The national revolutionaries have much respect to earn from the reactionary military, what with their previous conflicts during the cursed republic. Though it may be easier to purge our military opponents, the current situation only allows us to do one thing - gain their respect."

GER_restructure_high_command: "Restructure the High Command"
GER_restructure_high_command_desc: "For too long, the aristocratic officers that run the army have eaten up all potential that Germany has to offer, in return spitting out total mediocrity. With the victory of Valkism in the Reich, we must uproot the dreary high command and reinvigorate it with a new vision!"

GER_march_to_total_war: "The March to Total War"
GER_march_to_total_war_desc: "The next war will be the greatest war Germany will ever see. A war so total and grand that every element of the nation must be ready to fight it for us to hope to win. Unlike the decadent liberals and reds, the German people are ready to sacrifice everything to win the next war."

GER_politicize_officers: "Politicize the Officers"
GER_politicize_officers_desc: "Many officers - mistakenly - still submit to the idea of being apolitical. This idea is of course a total farce and fundamentally goes against the new military’s values. Whether they be in Zossen or on the field, every officer will know how to spread Germany’s greatness."

GER_eliminate_reactionaries: "Eliminate the Reactionaries"
GER_eliminate_reactionaries_desc: "The Valkist revolution is not merely a revolution in political terms, but also in economic and military terms too. Many monarchists and other reactionary elements still lurk in the army, readying themselves to sacrifice Germany for their own demented ideas. They will be removed."

GER_reinforce_interservice_cooperation: "Institut für Strategische Studien"
GER_reinforce_interservice_cooperation_desc: "The new military cannot suffer from the same myopic and toxic atmosphere as the Kaiser’s military did. The army, navy and airforce have to be united for us to successfully wage war and a new academy to breed this interservice cooperation has long been called for. Now, the time has come for this academy to be established."

GER_create_the_okr: "Finalize Our Plans"
GER_create_the_okr_desc: "A relic of the old system, the Reichswehr ministry has maintained itself as a sort of supreme combined command whereby all of the major services are able to cooperate. However, this system is ad-hoc and frankly too outdated for our new purposes. To this end, the ministry shall be removed totally and replaced by a new high command, a supreme high command over the entire military."

GER_form_the_wehrmacht: "Form the Wehrmacht"
GER_form_the_wehrmacht_desc: "Dressler’s death is undoubtedly a great tragedy that we must mourn. Nevertheless, we must understand that he was curiously stubborn on the question of the high command. With him out of the picture, his allies are willing to grant us the chance to properly create what Germany has always needed - the Wehrmacht."

GER_yc_valkist_compromise_army: "Reconcile Prussian Heritage"
GER_yc_valkist_compromise_army_desc: "As the national revolution engulfs Germany, we must remember our heritage - why we fight for Germany. Prussia and its values has always been at the bedrock of the valiant German army, an army that has never been truly defeated before. This time, no one shall steal our victory away."

GER_enshrine_officer_loyalty: "Enshrine Traditional Loyalty"
GER_enshrine_officer_loyalty_desc: "There is no Prussian virtue quite like loyalty. No matter who reigns, whether it be Kaiser, President or Führer, the army will always diligently and courageously serve Germany. Even if the real efficacy of the Valkist revolution is doubtful, the Heer will always serve without question."

GER_overlook_monarchist_sentiments: "Overlook Monarchist Sentiments"
GER_overlook_monarchist_sentiments_desc: "Whilst monarchism has found few supporters amongst the German public, the senior officers of the Heer most certainly have not forgotten who they swore their oath to. The Hohenzollerns and their respective noble vassals may be disgraceful, but we cannot let that cloud our view of reality. Their presence may be tolerated - for now."

GER_loosen_staff_oversight: "Loosen Staff Oversight"
GER_loosen_staff_oversight_desc: "Much of the aristocratic officer class are undoubtedly talented at warmaking In concord with our Young Conservative allies, we ought to leave them to make their own decisions, lest they be prevented from taking the militarily suggestable course."

GER_expel_troublemakers: "Expel Troublemakers"
GER_expel_troublemakers_desc: "With the end of the disgraced TST, many of the foul gangsters and thugs that polluted the organization have opted to join the Heer. These vagabonds sully our reputation and have only proven as effective cannon fodder, warranting their expulsion."

GER_undefeated_heer: "The Undefeated Heer"
GER_undefeated_heer_desc: "From battle to battle, the Heer has fought bravely. We remained undefeated in the first Weltkrieg, suffering through the Stellungskrieg only to be stabbed in the back. Then the second war came, this time the Führer nobly led Germany into an unprecedented struggle. With that war won, Germany has awoken - and no one will be able to stop her!"

GER_tst_valkist_compromise_army: "Fealty to the Führer"
GER_tst_valkist_compromise_army_desc: "The relationship between the Heer and the TST has always been a stormy one, with rivalry between the two armed military services always taking the foray in their mutual dealings. With the Führer having made peace with the TST however, the time has come for the army to not attack, but aid our more devoted comrades."

GER_enforce_ideological_education: "Enforce Ideological Education"
GER_enforce_ideological_education_desc: "In spite of our initial attempts to inspire loyalty to valkism and the Reich, it seems that many aristocrats have forgone this approach to instead teach rudimentary skills like leadership and tactics. This must be corrected, for only when the German soldiers are nationally and ideologically inspired can they win the fight."

GER_integrate_the_tst: "Integrate the TST Apparatus"
GER_integrate_the_tst_desc: "With the TST and the Heer growing ever larger, the administrative differences and rivalry between the two only grow. The integration of the TST is therefore the only solution as it will strengthen the national-mindedness and fervour of the soldiers, where no better soldiers thereof can be found outside of the TST."

GER_a_valkist_heer: "The Revolutionary Vanguard"
GER_a_valkist_heer_desc: "Every soldier is a soldier for valkism, whether they be fighting for it in the TST or serving in the Heer.

GER_volkssturm: "Unleash the Storm"
GER_volkssturm_desc: "The storm that will overrun Europe and beyond is the Valkist storm. A storm that the German people will unleash. This storm will be composed of the German people, who through their undeniable spiritual, racial and cultural superiority will simply annihilate all that stand in our way. Through them, we will unleash a storm that invokes terror in the heart and fear on the face of the reds, liberals and reactionaries that dare to resist their fate, in life or death."

GER_valkist_army: "Army of the Wotansknoten"
GER_valkist_army_desc: "There is no service that can quite match the heroism, courage nor tenacity of the Heer. We fight for the Führer, for Germany and for Valkism.

# TST Army

GER_german_peoples_army: "The German People’s Army"
GER_german_peoples_army_desc: "The German people for too long have put their faith into unworthy, mediocre aristocrats who fail to embody the true Germanic spirit. Betrayed at every point, the German people have finally overthrown their traitorous \"leaders\" and can finally create an army for and by the people of Germany."

GER_retrieve_old_guard: "Retrieve the Old Guard"
GER_retrieve_old_guard_desc: "As much as we would like to create an entirely new army, the reality is that it is simply unfeasible to overhaul nearly three centuries of tradition simply because some aristocrats proved unworthy. The old traditions still have some use for us and so we shall!"

GER_reintroduce_prussian_norms: "Reintroduce Prussian Norms"
GER_reintroduce_prussian_norms_desc: "Our heritage and tradition are undoubtedly some of the most important parts of the Germanic spirit, so why should this not apply to the Heer? The Prussian norms that enabled our great victories at Sedan and Tannenberg are priceless and they must be upheld."

GER_protect_valuable_officers: "Protect Valuable Officers"
GER_protect_valuable_officers_desc: "There are certain officers within the ranks who, despite being of undesirable background and attitude, are some of the most able and competent officers in their respective branches. We cannot let ideological fervor blind us to the practical necessity of competent officers."

GER_reduce_politicial_education: "Reduce Political Education"
GER_reduce_politicial_education_desc: "It is true that ideological education is a vital part of every German soldier’s training, but it cannot possibly be more important than actual combat training. We must scale back our efforts to indoctrinate every soldier if we are to successfully prepare the army for the next war."

GER_enforce_discipline: "Enforce Discipline"
GER_enforce_discipline_desc: "The nucleus of our new army is the TST, a ragtag band that originally stood for Valkism. Over time, they were betrayed by their leaders and eventually left behind. This has however seemed to breed a culture of thugs and gangsters who make for poor soldiers - and whose behaviour shall be rectified."

GER_reject_military_kirchenkamp: "Reject Anti-Christian Dogma"
GER_reject_military_kirchenkamp_desc: "Many soldiers in the new people’s army hold steadfastly, for better or worse, to Christianity. Many senior officers are also Christian and their experience and support is valuable to the army’s redemption. As such, they should be free to prove themselves worthy rather than oppressed for their faith."

GER_standardize_the_tst: "Standardize the Stormtroopers"
GER_standardize_the_tst_desc: "The brave fighters of the Trutzbündische Stoßtruppe have for a long time bravely stood against the international machinations of socialism, the West and Jewry as a whole.

GER_heirs_of_frederick: "The Heirs of Frederick"
GER_heirs_of_frederick_desc: "In many ways, we find ourselves at the crossroads of military development just like Frederick. He reformed the Prussian army into a force to be reckoned with and beat the odds that fate had stacked against Germany. As he won through brilliance and the triumph of the will, we too shall crush Germany's foes - until there is no one left to threaten her!"

GER_a_new_course: "A New Course"
GER_a_new_course_desc: "The old Prussian ways have failed. Their overemphasis on simply moving around your opponent fails to utilize the natural superiority of the German people in their struggle against oppression. The stormtroopers shall lead the way for the new Germany."

GER_military_elite: "A Military Elite"
GER_military_elite_desc: "The TST are not a mere spearhead nor ideological core of the army as some shirkers may like it to be, but rather it is the vanguard of a new Germany. The best of the best shall be the soldiers who lead Germany into victory against the weaklings in east and west."

GER_local_superiority: "Local Tactical Superiority"
GER_local_superiority_desc: "Far too much emphasis has been placed on operational success. Whilst such success is no doubt important, what is far more important is the victory of the soldier on each and every battlefield. The stormtroopers shall provide this with their elite standards, paving the way for the German people."

GER_pardon_valkist_officers: "Pardon Valkist Officers"
GER_pardon_valkist_officers_desc: "Even if Schleicher is a bastard and traitor, his military views were not entirely wrong. Many Valkist officers have developed a strategic view that will provide much depth to our reforms that have been mostly tactical and structural so far. The total people’s war shall be the war Germany wins!"

GER_reformed_training_standards: "Reformed Training Standards"
GER_reformed_training_standards_desc: "Military dogma would suggest that drill and procedure are the most important things a soldier learns. This however is not only wrongheaded, but takes away from the training a soldier needs in physical capabilities. A revised training regimen, stricter but more comprehensive in sports and other activities is in order."

GER_der_sturmer: "Der Stürmer"
GER_der_sturmer_desc: "At the end of the last war, we had devised the correct strategy.

GER_first_branch_among_equals: "Champion the Heer’s Supremacy"

GER_the_missing_element: "The Missing Element"
GER_the_missing_element_desc: "In the last war, what we lacked to properly come out victorious was mobility.

GER_prepare_for_worst: "Expand Defensive Plans"
GER_prepare_for_worst_desc: "No plan survives first contact with the enemy, this is an unfortunate fact.

GER_reshaping_the_german_economy_desc: "As the dark clouds of The Great War's aftermath still loom over our proud nation, we find ourselves shackled by the Bremen Accords, a constant reminder of the sacrifices and territorial losses endured, striking even at the heart of our economic vitality. The old Weimar Republic crumbled, its foundations shaken by both the insatiable greed of capitalism and the false promises of communism. Yet, in this time of uncertainty, Adam Dressler emerges as the harbinger of a new dawn. With the Rhineland under the watchful eyes of foreign powers, determined to restore the honor and might of the Deutsches Reich, Dressler envisions a radical overhaul of our economic landscape. Moving away from the outdated models of the past, we shall chart a new path, where the state, with unwavering precision, dictates our economic destiny. Through the steadfast ideals of Valkism, the Reich is poised not merely to rebuild but to soar, asserting its unparalleled prowess in a new era. We will embrace a new era of total state control, ensuring maximum efficiency, unity, and national prosperity."

The aftermath of The Great War has left us with the imperative to harness the untapped potential of the Harz Mountains' silver deposits, the salt mines of Thuringia, and the lignite veins of Saxony. We chart our course towards self-sufficiency, every vein of resource within our borders becomes a beacon of hope. In this endeavor, our industrious workers are not just laborers but the very heart of the German resurgence. Employing state-of-the-art machinery and innovative techniques, they will be galvanized under a united banner, driven by a singular purpose: to fortify our economic bedrock. Advanced machinery, pioneering research, and unparalleled German engineering will be the cornerstones of this initiative. Together, in this melding of sweat and steel, they lay the foundation for the Reich's re-emergence as a global economic powerhouse, demonstrating the indomitable spirit of the German people."

German engineers and scientists have embarked on a groundbreaking endeavor: the advanced Fischer-Tropsch process of coal liquidization. This pioneering technique promises to convert our copious coal reserves into synthetic oil, laying the groundwork for a self-sustaining energy revolution. With coal liquidization, our scientists and engineers embark on a mission to transform this abundant black gold into a vital fuel source. No longer will the Reich be beholden to foreign oil, allowing our economy to operate with newfound vigor and independence, ensuring the Reich's economic engines run smoothly. Yet, beyond the furnaces and factories, a more silent and strategic preparation unfolds. With each drop of synthetic fuel produced, the gears of a silent, mechanized beast stir to life. The Reich's military ambitions grow, and with each passing day, our forces become increasingly formidable.

With the establishment of the Reichsforschungsrat, or the Reich Research Council (RFR), tasked with the centralized coordination of both basic and applied research, our innovative spirit will shake off the shackles of the oppressive powers of the Bremen Accords. Under the RFR's oversight, endeavors such as harnessing nuclear power, the advancement of aeronautics, and pioneering breakthroughs in radio communication are set into motion, aiming to further elevate the Reich's unmatched technological prowess. Yet, this commitment to science also bears a dual purpose, as a more pressing objective takes precedence. Behind closed doors, the brightest minds of the Reich channel their efforts into projects that will secure our military dominance.

The materialist vision of Marx was based on nineteenth-century science, while the twentieth century will be the age of psychology. We no longer believe in the power of reason over life. We feel that it is life which dominates reason. A true German revolution will end the excesses of capitalism and bring total unity of the folk, an end of selfish individualism in favor of a true national community.

We shared everything we had as fraternal brothers who fought together in the face of war and death. Our return after the war has shown us that this unifying fraternal spirit of the front is leaking in our nation, instead society is tearing itself apart and Germany was divided between class, parties, ideologies and so much more. This misguided materialistic class struggle has done more harm than any treason, defeat or cowardice on the frontline ever did to our nation. We need to translate this frontline solidarity from our own military experience to civilian life and broader society in general.

According to Paetel, socialism can always work with a nationalist basis opposed to the marxist internationalism. He envisioned a great alliance of all nationalist forces, marching united into a new dawn for Germany. More concretely he proposes a completely state run command economy and a total nationalization. Paetel certainly has friends within the higher Valkist ranks but many feel that his movement bears the stench of marxism and would do more damage than good, while others see the main opponent Possedism as a mere compromise with parasitic capitalists."

It is an ideology wholly unique to our movement and almost synonymous with Valkism. Possedism argues for a controlled economy that still allows personal ambition but redirects it to serve the needs of the nation and the people. It envisioned high state intervention and curbing capitalist excess while not falling into the trappings of marxism. It is only natural that we now adapt the theory for our administration."

Germany refuses to be swayed by the whims of those who have cast aside their sense of humanity towards our people. Trusting in such erratic powers for our economic future is a gamble the Reich refuses to take. Instead, our gaze shifts towards emerging and steadfast partners. Nations like the Netherlands, with their vast maritime network, Hungary and its rich agricultural resources, or even Sweden with its coveted iron ore, beckon with promises of mutual growth and respect. The Dutch know all too well that the West will use them, the Hungarians know of their vengeful nature. Aligning with these trustworthy allies, we take the reins of our foreign trade, charting a course free from the tumultuous storms crafted by London and Paris.

Paetel's fusion of Valkism with an unwavering socialist core has illuminated a path where the power of the individual is magnified, not diminished, when melded seamlessly with the state's overarching authority. By nationalizing every furnace, factory, and field, we shall harness their full potential. In this new dawn, the Reich will not merely oversee but become the beating heart of every industry, every farm, every workshop. Every gear that turns and every plow that breaks the soil will do so for the benefit of the worker before anyone else. It's a union of ideology and action, where Germany's indomitable spirit is channeled through the mechanisms of an economy humming in perfect, state-guided harmony.

These councils, acting as bridges between the workforce and the state, will oversee production quotas, working conditions, and the distribution of essential resources within their sectors. Every worker, through these councils, is granted a voice, but it's a voice harmonized and guided by the grander Valkist symphony. Embodying the German spirit, they are not mere echoes of Bolshevist councils that promote division and class warfare. Instead, they signify the unity of the German Volk, working in concert with the state's overarching direction. These councils will operate under the Valkist umbrella, with state-appointed overseers ensuring alignment with national objectives and maintaining the necessary hierarchies. The paramount distinction lies in the ethos: while communism endlessly chants about class struggle and revolutionary fervor, the German Worker Councils emphasize unity, cooperation, and unwavering loyalty to the Deutsches Reich. Germany, with its new system, strengthens its communal bonds without veering into the treacherous waters of communism. The result?

Furthermore, education centers will be erected in rural regions, offering courses in modern farming techniques while weaving in the principles of Valkist thought, instilling a renewed sense of purpose in every farmer, every villager, ensuring they feel not just the embrace of the state but also its unwavering spirit. Distinct from any Marxist promise of rural utopia, the Valkist approach to the countryside intertwines economic pragmatism with cultural reverence. But these measures are not merely economic. They serve a dual purpose of sowing the cultural seeds of the country's future, to reap a generation of farmers that will know their value and home in the nation. This is the union of tradition and progress, where every grain sown and harvested resonates with the might and vision of the German state, placing it within the grand mosaic of the Reich.

Their grand boulevards and storied spires, though still echoing with the whispers of a golden age, have become theater stages for fervent debates and intellectual pursuits now rumbling with discord and distrust. But the ever-watchful Führer, with a vision both awe-inspiring and hauntingly meticulous, shall cast a rejuvenating spell upon them. The streets will not just be awash with light and fervor; they will pulse with the gaze of the state, he envisions the cities not just as hubs of commerce, but as bastions of Valkist unity. Police presence will intensify, media systems will be modernized, and more importantly, youth and worker organizations will be mobilized to champion the Valkist ideology. Artistic marvels will rise, singing praises of Germanic brilliance and the indomitable Valkist spirit. Dilapidated infrastructures will be revamped, public squares will see the erection of symbols celebrating German might and Valkist ideals, and educational institutions will be given a fresh curriculum that instills both knowledge and patriotism. Yet, for all their resplendent glory, an unspoken understanding will linger in the air: these urban wonders stand as a symbol to the need for unity."

GER_promote_folkish_unity_desc: "Drawing inspiration from the resilience and spirit of the ancient Germanic tribes, the Führer and Paetel aim to infuse the heart of the Reich with the timeless essence of our ancestors. They envisage a harmonious blend of past and present, where streets are alive with the pulse of modern life, yet reverberate with echoes of tradition. Every town, village, and city will celebrate its distinct historical roots, each contributing to the overarching German narrative. Communities will be encouraged to cherish and honor their unique heritage, culminating in a unified tapestry of tradition and pride. It's in this shared identity that the magic of folkish unity lies: a celebration of heritage, unity, and unwavering patriotism. Under this renewal, communities will experience a deepened sense of connection, strengthening bonds between individuals and the enduring spirit of the Reich."

GER_trasition_to_german_common_law_desc: "In a time where reverence for our ancient Germanic heritage grows, the lingering grip of Roman legalities has become a burden. With Dressler's determined vision and the pride of Germanic leadership, the Reich is set on a transformative journey to reclaim its judicial foundations. It's time for Germany to delve deeper into its native traditions. The remnants of Roman common law, while once embraced, will be methodically replaced with legal principles reflecting the valor of our Germanic predecessors. German jurisprudence will emerge anew, resonating with the bravery of Hermann and the wisdom passed down through generations. This legal system will prioritize the Fatherland's interests, sidelining foreign influences as echoes from bygone eras. With each decree, our nation will embody this revived spirit, ensuring state and citizenry stride forward in unity, unburdened by external legacies. Through this transformative shift, the Reich reclaims its esteemed position as a true embodiment of its historic roots and values."

These guardians of our sacred soil, the very embodiment of Germanic resilience, have for too long been shackled by the heartless machinery of capitalism. The Führer, visionary of the German spirit, now heralds a luminous dawn where these tireless sons and daughters of the Reich are elevated to their rightful pedestal. As the corporate giants, which once overshadowed our fertile plains, are uprooted and cast aside, the verdant lands of our nation will be apportioned with deliberate care and handed back to our agrarian stalwarts. Each parcel signifies not just land, but honor, recognition of unwavering service and dedication to the soil and state. This isn't merely an allocation; it's a restitution. Through this noble act, the Reich not only restores its physical territory but revitalizes its spirit, entrusting every patch and pasture to those who revere it most. In this golden age, the verdant fields will flourish as they once did, a testament to a people whose identity is forever linked with the land they cultivate. This is Dressler’s vision: a Reich where the common man thrives, not under the red banner of international socialism, but under the proud banner of Germania."

Furthermore we have seen the chaos and problems homelessness and poverty causes during the reign of corrupt capitalism and parliamentarism. It is contrary to the idea of the Volksgemeinschaft and the Valkist ideal to let this happen again.

Still, we secured the Reich from the threat of a communist takeover and ripped it from the grasps of the oligarchic parties. The Economy is recovering and the military rearmament is progressing as planned.

With unemployment still rampant thanks to the internationalist liberals of Weimar, their failures must now be rectified by our solutions. One of such solutions is the creation of a mandatory work service in which all men must serve before conscription and which should also potentially include women.

It is apparent that some of them hold sympathies to our great cause and we should use that to our advantage. If we can sway at least some of them to our side, it will make work easier.

Nepotism, old elites and big business crushed the work ethic and spirit of honest, competent German people. It allowed lazy, incompetent and worst of all unpatriotic elements to form the elite instead. The Whilemine era however was not much better, the old aristocracy became detached and degenerate, far from the ideal of the warrior and philosopher Kings of old.

Liberals with their naive notions of parliamentary democracy simply do not understand the true nature of democracy, the inherent relationship of the rulers and the ruled.

We will instead strife to build in a way befitting our great future and movement using modern materials and methods. Valkist buildings will radiate strength, order and monumentality, the cities will be a temple to the German Volk and the countryside a testament to our age old traditions. Our buildings should be made to last, to impress and to work efficiently. Straight lines, strong materials, reduced ornament and monumentality for public places will be the leading design principles."

A certain chaos that allows for a reconstructive revolution is necessary to create a new order and finalize our mission since the collapse of 1919. While we have achieved victory on the political front, we now need to use our power as a basis for the social revolution that has to follow the political one, else our victory be for naught. The downfall of the Republicans after the war was their timid nature, unable to finish the revolution which led Germany into a state of chaos and nothingness characterized by the rise of political parties and class warfare. This is the difference between the marxist and liberal revolutions and the reconstructive Valkist revolution, which has the sole purpose to give rise to a new Valkist social order, while finally and completely destroying the old conservative, liberal and leftist aspects of society."

GER_question_of_faith: "Question of Faith"
GER_question_of_faith_desc: "Religion has always been a thorn in our side. The feeble christian morality and its outdated norms serve a conservative order we aim to overcome. Our leadership is keenly aware of the shortcomings the spirit of Christ has imposed on our people. However it would be foolish to pretend to worship made up Germanic gods, like little kids dressing up in costumes. It is true that our ancestral faith would be closer to our vision but we also need to accept the realities of the time that such a faith is lost and Christianity has deeply entrenched itself. Unlike conservatives we will never simply accept the influence of the Church on our nation, but we also oppose the godless atheism of the marxists. Instead we should aim to create out of mythical heroism and Christianity will either be reforged by Valkism or be replaced by its new ethos eventually. Religion is an important tool for our cultural vision and it would be foolish to disregard it."

The worker will be the force that is selfless, part of the Volksgemeinschaft and obedient to the German Reich. It will destroy the bourgeois class and be led by an efficient technocratic bureaucracy. Modern technology and spiritual elitism will lead Germany through the corrosive days of modernism. For the worker is not only a social class, but insteads a mindset, a state of being, fully subject to his Volk, his Reich, his Führer and a heroic realism only known from the trenches of the Great War.

A man for a job and nothing more. Yet he took power to himself, corrupted by it and created a deranged mirror image of the very modernist order he vowed to destroy.

It disbanded after years of Valkist harassment and merged into their national movement. Its name holds our most important idea as an acronym, Juvenum Unio Novum Imperium.

GER_expand_the_corporate_stateism_desc: "The corporatism of the Valkists incorporated many radical revolutionary ideas that simply only served to deepen class conflict by attacking the bourgeoisie. While we are certainly no friends of the industrialists, we will not promote class warfare like Dressler did. Instead, we will implement a culture of corporate statism, as outlined by Othmar Spann and his idea of the Ständestaat. These corporations will be the basis of local cooperation, national democracy and participation of the Volk."

We will need to remedy this problem by enforcing class cooperation and eradicate the proletarian identity in favor of a nationalist christian worker ethos. Our goal will be to unite employers and employees in the Reich Economic Chamber under a united Nationalist Trade Union. Furthermore we will make sure that local representatives will create departments in all federal states and we will nationalize the largest companies to be directly overseen by the Economic Chamber. Our guideline in this undertaking will be the ideas of Prussian Socialism, that Spengler already outlined."

GER_enshrine_christian_values_desc: "The hate for Christianity is understandable in its current form but what neither valkists nor völkisch realize is that Christianity is a foundation, a pillar of order in the modernist world that we can not and should not simply erase. The values of Christianity were not made up in Rome, but instead reflect the eternal truths of the world. We only need to reform the beliefs and these eternal values will guide our way, rather than launching a costly, radical revolution."

GER_form_new_national_elite: "Form a New National Elite"
GER_form_new_national_elite_desc: "It's true, the old aristocracy has failed us and the new money has only worked to enrich themselves. What we need is a true organic natural elite that is ready to rise up and take the position of leadership after our reconstructive revolution. Since the collapse of 1919, only few such men were produced and while Valkism located this elite within the circles of soldiers and Veterans, we see that those great men and thinkers who never lost faith in the great German project are those who are ready to form a nationalist vanguard. Those who realized the failure of parties and radicalism, the treachery of capitalism and the egoism of marxism. The Valkists were the first step to end the chaos, but it is from within the ranks of those men that a natural aristocracy will resurface in the appearance of the Young German movement."

GER_enforce_strict_federalism: "Enforce Strict Federalism"
GER_enforce_strict_federalism_desc: "The federalism of Weimar was a farce. The state was still dominated by Prussia and Berlin, while the others were left to their own devices. True federalism has to work like an organism where each estate and every state has to work together for the greater whole. The federalism that Dressler envisioned merely was a tool to weaken the states and establish new Valkist structures. Our federal project will be based upon the work of the Bavarian Reichsreform movement and establish a truly federal order united and working in unisom under the Reich."

GER_united_christian_church_desc: "There are many esoteric sects and projects to reform Christianity towards a national outlook. Whilst most of these are found within the undesirable völkisch circles, not all of them are without merit. The Christianity that the Young German Order propagates for example is one of a united German church modeled after the knightly orders of old and Prussian State Protestantism. We will create a united Christian Reichskirche, to oppose both Protestant and Catholic confessions and foster true belief under the guiding hands of the Führer and Reich."

GER_faith_and_order_against_anarchy_of_modernism_desc: "Our Christian faith is the bulwark of central Europe. It is the manifestation of eternal truths and the natural order. Sadly, this faith was corrupted by factionalism, the material Church in Rome and the degenerative influences of the weak plebeian ethos of Protestantism. An ordered, hierarchical corporatist society has to not only enforce cooperation and unity of the Volk, but also a renewal of a pure true faith as one of the pillars for the Young German Order.

He is the one responsible to establish an elite with merit and purpose that is able to properly lead the people. The Führer is not a despot who reigns against his people or a monarch through the grace of god. He is the organic manifestation of the Volk.

GER_no_more_parties_only_germans_desc: "We will once and for all ban all vestiges of liberal party politics in Germany. This stranglehold of irresponsibility, sickly individualism, greed and egoism needs to be overcome and prevented from spreading its roots again on German soil. The big mistake of Dressler was that he never fully managed to get rid of the thought of parties and even now as we speak, opposition groups dedicated to restoring this wicked system still operate. Something we will have to put an end to. Our work is only done when the political party is a faint bad memory in the mind of the average German."

GER_depoliticise_the_masses_desc: "Mass political movements only serve to destabilize the state and divide the people. It favors deception, short term gain and internal ongoing war.

Due to their natural Darwinist struggle for survival, the dream of an international proletariat is deluded. Instead, we propose a different socialism for every Volk. This means that the proletariat will be incorporated into an organic society based on class corporations that rewards the daring vanguard ready to fight for the Volksgemeinschaft. The egoistic and greedy capitalist forces will be defeated and instead solidarity, unity and order under the leadership of a Führer and a new national elite will enforce a new order.

Ever since Dressler’s betrayal of Germany in his wicked submission to the Reichswehr and ensuing breakdown of authority within Germany, we must now disavow Valkism and begin following the classical Völkisch thought created by visionaries and geniuses the likes of Ludendorff, Wirth and Reventlow."

It is therefore imperative that we return to the natural order of things and disavow the foreign ideas of modernism, globalism and urbanism.

While the young organization grew quickly through the incorporation of many esoteric and völkish scientific circles, its output so far is mediocre at best, and critics ridicule the Ahnenerbe as a "cheap propaganda tool only good for writing bad fiction novels." Sadly, at least some of the criticism has merit, as the organization has produced questionable works that put our regime in a bad light.

While it is true that the pagans of old are dead, we will embark on a long journey to create our own popular civil religion.

GER_europe_united_behind_dressler_desc: "What can be said about Adam Dressler that has not been said already?

Hail to Führer Adam Dressler - who is with us always!"

GER_the_iron_core: "The Iron Core"
GER_the_iron_core_desc: "There is but one heart of civilized Europe - its center. Populated by the superior Germanic peoples, we have now inherited this bastion and now it is our duty to fortify and defend this core against the machinations of the international anti-German cabal."

GER_germanisation_efforts: "Germanisation Efforts"
GER_germanisation_efforts_desc: "Germany is not merely a concept. Rather, Germany runs in the blood of the Germanic peoples, whose racial superiority remains without dispute. It is thus the Volk’s destiny to assert their superiority and right history by expelling the inferior elements of society across Europe."
GER_germanisation_efforts_tt: "§LWe will be able to enact a new occupation law, §Y$lebensraum$§! across all places in Europe that we claim.§!\n\n§gAdditionally, our efforts may be rewarded in the form of §YCompliance Modifiers§! at §145%§! and §685%§! compliance respectively. Their effects are as follows:\n§!"

GER_fortress_europe: "Festung Europa"
GER_fortress_europe_desc: "Our control of Europe must be without question, not just from within Europe but also from without. As long as any other power holds even a square inch on Europe, Germany and her people will not be safe and neither can the preservation of white European civilization be maintained. As such, it is the German people’s burden to protect Europe from the mongrels and barbarians of the East and West."

GER_pan_germanism: "Righting Versailles"
GER_pan_germanism_desc: "The Treaty of Versailles was one of the most disgraceful events in German history, rivaled only by Napoleon's dictate at Tilsit. The treaty partially reversed German Unification, splitting up Germans into artificial states and crippling our once proud military. Our main goal shall be to reverse this injustice and avenge our humiliation in the Great War."

GER_the_kiel_gambit: "The Kiel Gambit"
GER_the_kiel_gambit_desc: "With the recent global economic downturn, the time has come for one of the many mistakes of Versailles to be righted. The disgusting Kiel mandate shall be rightfully exorcised from existence and for Schleswig-Holstein to finally be liberated from foreign oppression.."

GER_remilitarise_dmzs: "Enforce Territorial Sovereignty"
GER_remilitarise_dmzs_desc: "If we are to prove that Germany is a power deserving recognition like those of Paris and London, we must be able to control our own borders! We shall take back our lands away from the prying eyes of the Entente and their Anglo-Saxon liberal masters, ensuring that Germany will remain safe and secure."

GER_free_trade_agreement_austria: "Force Trade Upon Vienna"
GER_free_trade_agreement_austria_desc: "The Austrian state has fallen on hard times. Perhaps by strengthening economic relations we can bring them into our sphere of influence, making it easier to pressure them into union."

GER_demand_sudetenland: "Demand Sudeten Liberation"
GER_demand_sudetenland_desc: "Ever since the collapse of Czechoslovakia, the Bohemians have cracked down hard on the Sudeten Germans. With the region being the birthplace of the Fuhrer himself, it has become a matter of not only national security but personal pride that the region joins the fatherland."

GER_invade_bohemia: "Crush the Czechs"
GER_invade_bohemia_desc: "With the independence of Slovakia, the Czechs are more isolated than ever. It would hence be very easy to destroy them and at last relegate them to their rightful place in the world - as part of Greater Germany."

GER_balkan_affairs: "Into the Powderkeg"
GER_balkan_affairs_desc: "The Balkan Peninsula is notoriously unstable, to the point it was awarded the morbid title as the \"powder keg of Europe\". It should be easy to implement a strategy of divide and rule, although the region has the potential to become a strategic quagmire for us."
GER_balkan_affairs_trigger_1: "We at least control @AUS §YAustria§! or @SHO §YSchleswig-Holstein§! in their entirety"

GER_war_with_austria: "Complete Anschluß"
GER_war_with_austria_desc: "For decades, Austria's position when it came to the German Question was unclear. This became an even more pressing matter after the Great War ended and the Habsburg Monarchy collapsed. It is clear that German unification is not complete without the Austrians by our side. "

GER_allies_in_budapest: "Allies in Budapest"
GER_allies_in_budapest_desc: "There are fewer examples of the liberal world order’s cruelty than in Trianon, where our Hungarian brothers-in-arms were crushed and broken down. Now like us, the Hungarians have realized their destiny and now it is time we join together in the grand repudiation of the Entente world order."

GER_subjugate_hungary: "Subjugate Hungary"
GER_subjugate_hungary_desc: "Whilst our nations may have much in common, the reality is that Hungary is weak. Without us, they would be nothing and their grandiose dreams of reconquest would be little more than fantastical delusions. Thus, we must take the next step to ensure they will not stray out of line."

GER_fate_slovakia: "The Fate of Slovakia"
GER_fate_slovakia_desc: "Much like the Czechs, the Slovak nation is a product of Versailles. Their fate was sealed, the moment the Czechoslovak state collapsed: to be crushed under our heel."

GER_visit_to_belgard: "Visit to Belgrade"
GER_visit_to_belgard_desc: "While we have our differences with the Yugoslavs, allying ourselves with them gives us a strategic advantage. Belgrade has grown resentful towards the Italians after they were denied Fiume and a large chunk of Dalmatia. rapprochement would grant us resources and ports on the Adriatic. "

GER_germano_yugo_summit: "The Zagreb Conference"
GER_germano_yugo_summit_desc: "There are few governments with the wisdom to realize that the old order is coming to an end. Luckily, the betrayed Yugoslavs have seen the light, and improved relations have now made possible an alliance between our nations - which we shall now see to fruition."
GER_germano_yugo_summit_start_tt: "§gWe will be able to propose different ways to deepen our ties with Belgrade over the course of completing the focus: which may result in a combination of any one of the following effects:\n§!"

GER_divide_the_balkans: "Divide and Conquer"
GER_divide_the_balkans_desc: "The nations of the Balkans are a petty bunch, often feuding between themselves. They also possess key resources we need for the upcoming war, such as the Romanian oil fields. With no one to stop us, we can now secure the region by any means necessary, both to gain new allies and protect the German populations in the Balkans."
GER_divide_the_balkans_tt: "§gAt least one Balkan nation remains outside of our sphere§!"

GER_yugo_investements: "Yugoslavian Investments"
GER_yugo_investements_desc: "While fragile, the Yugoslavs possess a large military and many resources that we need for the coming war. Influencing them economically will enable us to put pressure on the Italians and bases on the Adriatic."

GER_the_future_of_bulgaria: "The Fate of Bulgaria"
GER_the_future_of_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria was crippled by their defeat in the Great War. As such, they could prove to be a natural ally with their many grievances against their neighbours. However, they could prove to be a hindrance. Should we invite them into our alliance as brothers, or leave them to the wolves?"

GER_support_greece: "Support Athens"
GER_support_greece_desc: "Despite being on the winning side of the Great War, the Greeks resent being under the British sphere of influence, and were denied control of Constantinople. They would make a far more worthy ally than the Turks."

GER_support_turkey: "Support Ankara"
GER_support_turkey_desc: "We share many similar aspects with the Turks. They too were wronged by the vile Entente, torn into pieces. They have begun rearming. An alliance with them and we can strike into the Caucasus with ease, and perhaps even further beyond..."

GER_safeguard_the_straits: "Securing the Straits"
GER_safeguard_the_straits_desc: "The Bosphorus straits are too valuable to be left in the hands of a hostile power. Controlling it will not only help to ensure mastery over the Black Sea, but will also greatly ease logistical matters in Anatolia and beyond."
GER_safeguard_the_straits_tt: "Either §Gwe or our allies§! are in close proximity to the §YBosphorus Straits§!, without being controlled by us"

GER_question_romania: "Deal with Bucharest"
GER_question_romania_desc: "Romania is the most powerful country in the Balkans, possessing a large army and Europe's largest oil reserves. Although they dance to Paris’s tune, this does not mean that we ought to be unable to deal with them."

GER_eastern_claims: "Reclaiming the East"
GER_eastern_claims_desc: "Of our territorial losses, the most egregious were in the East. There is also the matter of the many Germans scattered across the lands of the former Russian Empire, who must be reunited with the fatherland."

GER_demand_eastern_lands: "Demand Eastern Territories"
GER_demand_eastern_lands_desc: "Various territories, such as Posen and Memel, were stripped from us in 1919. Chafing under irresponsible government, it is not only our prerogative to liberate all Germans under foreign rule, but rather our moral duty!"

GER_question_lithuania: "Deal with Lithuania"
GER_question_lithuania_desc: "Memel was taken from us and absorbed into Lithuania. This already places them in a dubious position, not to mention that control over the country would give us a springboard towards the rest of the Baltic States."

GER_diplomatic_mission_ukraine: "Mission to Kyiv"
GER_diplomatic_mission_ukraine_desc: "Like many other nations, Ukraine broke away in the chaos of the Russian Civil War. With the Russians regaining strength, offering them our assistance will prove extremely valuable to our influence there, to the point where they might essentially be put under our thumb."
GER_diplomatic_mission_ukraine_tt: "§gWe will send a diplomatic mission to §CUkraine§!, with their efforts potentially resulting in the following:§!\n"

GER_anti_bolshevik_pact: "Anti-Bolshevik Pact"
GER_anti_bolshevik_pact_desc: "The biggest threat to our security is the specter of Bolshevism. The Reds have licked their wounds and will inevitably look west for revenge. An anti-Bolshevik alliance would thus potentially help place the nations of Central and Eastern Europe into our sphere."

GER_war_with_poland: "Vanquish Poland"
GER_war_with_poland_desc: "The Polish state lies in the way of our ambitions. Not even the last twenty years of pitiful existence have made it a worthy nation. Now that we have regained our glory, it is our duty to sweep away this artificial stain on the map of Europe and open our door to the east."

GER_ultimatum_baltic_states: "Secure the Baltic"
GER_ultimatum_baltic_states_desc: "The Baltic nations are weak and fear the return of Russian rule. Whether through offering them \"protection\" or through forceful subjugation, they can be easily brought into our sphere of influence and turned into a dagger at that wretched heart of the revolution in Leningrad."

GER_diplomatic_mission_minsk: "Mission to Minsk"
GER_diplomatic_mission_minsk_desc: "The fragile state of Belarus exists at the Russian doorstep. Once the construct of the Kaiser, the last twenty years have seen them withstand trial after tribulation. With past overtures having been highly successful, we ought to go forth and set our good relations into stone."

GER_invasion_of_spu: "The Final Struggle"
GER_invasion_of_spu_desc: "Europe is at a precipice. The fate of the greatest continent in the world is at stake, between the forces of civilization and the forces of Bolshevization. All of the righteous and true remaining in the world will support us in this crusade, the righting of the ultimate wrong born from the first war - the Soviet Union shall be annihilated."

GER_protect_finland: "Secure Finland"
GER_protect_finland_desc: "Finland gained its independence in 1918, but has been vulnerable to Bolshevik encroachment ever since. Allying them would enable us to strike at Leningrad and Murmansk, cutting off the Russians from some of their largest ports."

GER_negotiate_caucasus: "Secure the Caucasus"
GER_negotiate_caucasus_desc: "The states of the Caucasus are vital for our war aims. Their resources, especially the Baku oil fields, are needed by our war machine. Securing them would create a second front for the Russians, and a base for any potential strike into the Middle East."

GER_western_claims: "Facing the West"
GER_western_claims_desc: "With the loss of Alsace Lorraine and the Rhineland, our industrial capacity has been hamstrung. Additionally, there lies the most devious enemy that Germany has faced - the French. If Germany is to rise again, Paris must fall!"

GER_british_question: "The British Problem"
GER_british_question_desc: "With London’s retreat into isolation, the Entente Cordiale and British obligations on the continent have been neglected. Therefore, we have two choices: reconcile with our Anglo-Saxon brothers or destroy them?"

GER_antagonize_albion: "Antagonize Albion"
GER_antagonize_albion_desc: "The perfidious British have pursued maintaining a so-called \"balance of power\" within Europe ever since the fall of Napoleon. This has put us at odds with them, nevermind their fundamental opposition based on their role as the leader of international liberal capitalism. As peace with them is impossible, we have but only one choice: struggle!"

GER_support_rebels_empire: "Support Imperial Rebels"
GER_support_rebels_empire_desc: "There are many groups within the British colonies who wish nothing more than to throw off the shackles of foreign rule. Supplying rebels and dissidents with weapons and supplies would divert troops and potentially cripple them strategically."

GER_secure_swedish_iron: "Secure Swedish Iron"
GER_secure_swedish_iron_desc: "The Nordic countries are vital to the war effort, and none other as much as Sweden. With their vital iron ore critical to our war industries, it must be secured by any means necessary, even if that involves breaking the \"neutrality\" that these wayward Germanic brothers hold so dear."

GER_diplomatically_approach_british: "Approach London"
GER_diplomatically_approach_british_desc: "Despite being on opposite sides in the Weltkrieg, the British and we do not entirely disagree. A degree of re-approachment could grant us the free hand in Europe that may well be the deciding factor if we are to win the next war."

GER_gentlemans_trade_agreement: "A Gentlemen's Agreement"
GER_gentlemans_trade_agreement_desc: "Just as the British desire non-interference in their empire, we also desire their non-interference in Europe. A free hand in Europe is a prerequisite for any cooperation with London, but it is unlikely that this will come peacefully unless we start somewhere - of which a trade agreement of some kind might be the way forward."

GER_negotiate_naval_treaty: "Renegotiate Naval Treaties"
GER_negotiate_naval_treaty_desc: "After the Great War, restrictions were placed on the Reichsmarine to prevent a repeat of the U-Boat threat and a revival of the High Seas Fleet. However, we have no delusions of restoring the old fleet. We should approach London with a proposal to loosen the naval restrictions."

GER_british_london_axis: "The Berlin-London Axis"
GER_british_london_axis_desc: "Our diplomatic efforts have been fruitful beyond our wildest dreams. Our former enemy is now our ally, facing off the most powerful foes alongside each other. An alliance between our two nations hence is but a matter of time, for with the vast resources of the British Empire, nothing can stop the Anglo-Saxon world order. "

GER_anti_entente_propaganda: "Anti-Entente Propaganda"
GER_anti_entente_propaganda_desc: "It was perfidious Albion and the vile French who encircled us during the pre war years, stole our place in the sun, and forced us to sign a dishonourable peace treaty. It is clear that in order for the new Europe to rise, we must slay their wicked world order."

GER_begin_support_rhenish_valkists: "Destabilize Koblenz"
GER_begin_support_rhenish_valkists_desc: "The government in Koblenz is nothing but an artificial creation of Versailles, a puppet state of the French who preach nonsense ideas of republicanism and liberal democracy. Luckily, there are many in the Rhineland who wish for reunification and could prove useful as a fifth column in the event of war..."

GER_demand_referendum_rhineland: "Demand Rhineland Referendum"
GER_demand_referendum_rhineland_desc: "While the chances of success are low, pushing for a referendum would provide a major propaganda victory, and a casus belli for war. The Rhineland should not remain outside of Germany, and we shall see to its liberation!"

GER_belgian_question: "Secure Belgium"
GER_belgian_question_desc: "Just as in the First Great War, the best way to Paris is through the low countries of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. These states, when compared to either we or Paris, are puny ones, and they must be neutralized before the French can turn the tables on us!"

GER_question_swiss_neutrality: "Crush Switzerland"
GER_question_swiss_neutrality_desc: "The Swiss are majority German, but have so far refused to engage in European affairs, corrupting themselves with decadence and money. The plentiful financial capital of the Swiss shall be harnessed for the good of the German war effort, with the potential to outflank Franco-Italian forces in the region."

GER_alpine_wall: "Alpinewall"
GER_alpine_wall_desc: "While the Entente are unlikely to get through the Austrian Alps, one cannot help but be prepared. A series of fortifications along the Italo-German border shall be constructed."

GER_demand_referendum_tyrol: "Referendum in Tyrol"
GER_demand_referendum_tyrol_desc: "The Italian province of South Tyrol contains a sizable German population. They suffer under the Roman yoke, and must be liberated. A referendum in the German majority regions could potentially reunite them with the Fatherland."

GER_adreatic_agreement: "The Istrian Question"
GER_adreatic_agreement_desc: "Istria and its corresponding territories are undoubtedly highly valuable if we are to exert influence in the Mediterranean. However, any claims on it must also take Yugoslavia, one of the few prospective allies of the Reich, into consideration with their equally valid, if not more so, claim on the territory as well."
GER_adreatic_agreement_t: "§gIf we complete the focus §Y$GER_germano_yugo_summit$§! before this focus, we might gain the following effects:§!"

GER_dissolve_entente: "Overthrow Paris"
GER_dissolve_entente_desc: "The time is nigh. The hour of destiny will soon be upon us. Between us and the French, there can only be one vanguard of the West.

GER_DDR_WGR_civil_war_fervor_desc: "In the chaotic fury that has swept up Europe since the Great War, a storm has gathered over Germany. Führer Adam Dressler, once the beacon of German revitalization, has seen his once iron-clad grip on the nation's destiny wane. With every passing day, the foundations of his Valkist dreams crumble, as disillusionment and strife eat away at the fabric of a united Reich. In this vacuum of power, the TST, emboldened by the faltering leadership, has ignited the flames of open revolt, hoping to reshape Germany in its vision. Meanwhile, the Young Conservative movement, in a bid to preserve the nation's dignity and order, declares the formation of an Emergency German Government, positioning themselves as the rightful saviors of a nation teetering on the edge of desolation. The streets of the cities from Cologne to Berlin, once bustling with hope and pride, now echo with the sounds of conflict and fervent speeches, the fate of the nation hangs in the balance.

### Events

# Flavor, stuff that is interesting and everything in-between
gerflavor.0.t: "The Liberation of Austria"
gerflavor.0.d: "Barred from joining the German fatherland at the end of the Great War, the Austrian state lived a dismal existence. Bouncing from crisis to crisis, failure to failure, the useless government simply acted to subjugate themselves further and further to Entente interests. Worst of all, they even managed to turn brother against brother, forcing us to resort to a combination of diplomatic and military options that were sadly nothing but antagonistic towards what was a brother nation.\n\nBut no more! With the Austrian lands under our grasp now, never again shall Germans be divided along old imperial lines. As our forces parade through the streets and towns of old Austria, many Austrians are awakening to realize their destiny. Furthermore, this victory has granted us near universal applause from all sectors in the new Germany, with everyone celebrating our tireless endeavor for a unified greater Germany. Soon, Germany will be whole and happy once again!"
gerflavor.0.a: "So soll es ewig sein!"

gerflavor.1.t: "Röchling Gruppe"
gerflavor.1.d: "Now that we have reclaimed the Rhineland, many Germans, once chafing under plutocratic French dominion, have now come out of the woodwork to celebrate our liberation. Along with this, many traitors to the German people have fled into exile, with arch-capitalist and steel magnate Albert Vögler being one such man. This however has sent the steel industry into much upheaval, with the operations of Vereinigte Stahlwerke still being incorporated into our hands. To this end, some have suggested that we instead reach out to a more amiable magnate to prop up who will not only cooperate with the state, but has the best interests of Germany and Germans and heart.\n\nNow it seems that such a candidate has arisen. Taking charge in 1898, Hermann Röchling has overseen Völklinger Ironworks since the days of the Kaiser. A true nationalist, Röchling has agitated viciously against successive governments in the French-controlled Saar, funding numerous nationalist groups in the area to oppose Paris’s imperialism. Now with the Saar free, he has offered his services to the Führer despite our anti-capitalist tendencies, desiring to work for the good of the German people."
gerflavor.1.a: "Let us take him up on his offer!"
gerflavor.1.b: "He is just another plutocrat..."

gerflavor.2.t: "The Austrian Legion"
gerflavor.2.d: "If there is one goal that could unite every member of the Valkist coalition since the days of 1932, it would be the goal of a greater Germany. Whatever symbol they felt represented Germany best, the ultimate goal of the unification between the German peoples of Germany proper and of the Austrian state has always been a priority for the Führer, who now turns his eyes southward as Germany rises again.\n\nRather unfortunately, the government in Vienna does not share our view of things. Although we still maintain tense relations with them, the reality is that they are unlikely to peacefully accept any sort of unification of the Reich and her peoples - it would not be in the favour of the foreign masters! Along with this general hostility towards us, they have taken it upon themselves to crack down on the Valkist soldiers in their state who bravely fight for German freedom and unity.\n\nThis crackdown has unfortunately been more effective than we had hoped - especially with the lack of sympathy that Valkism faces in the Austrian population. Thankfully, many Austrians have been able to escape over the border, who have now rallied in the home of the Valkist revolution, Bavaria. Led by ardent Valkist Hermann Reschny, they have armed and trained themselves day and night for a glorious liberation of their German fatherland from the treacherous elites of Vienna!\n\nThis is, unfortunately however, an exaggerated version of reality. Reschny most certainly is a loyal Valkist, but the coordination and control that he holds on the Austrian valkists is tenuous at best and leaves much to be desired. Their current existence has also proven extremely poisonous to our relationship with Vienna, who needless to say dislikes the legion’s very existence. Now with our turn southwards, some are suggesting that we quietly shutter the legion and put its members to more productive use in Germany and perhaps even abroad. To counter this, old fighters of the movement have countered that it would be a monstrous betrayal of all that Valkism stands for to simply let them meekly return to normal society and hang the remaining Austrian faithful out to dry - even if such a move would give us needed resources and help patch up things temporarily with Vienna."
gerflavor.2.a: "Give them all the supplies and training they need!"
gerflavor.2.b: "It would be best to shutter them - for now..."
gerflavor.2.tt: "§7Should we end up at war with Austria, we will be able to raise the §YAustrian Legion§! as a division to fight for us.\n\nIf this division liberates Vienna, we will then gain a starting compliance of §G10%§! on all Austrian states as well as §G+10%§! §YStability§! and §rWar Support§!.§!"

gerflavor.3.t: "Dark Nights in Ostmark"
gerflavor.3.d: "If there is one goal that could unite every member of the Valkist coalition since the days of 1932, it would be the goal of a greater Germany. Whatever symbol they felt represented Germany best, the ultimate goal of the unification between the German peoples of Germany proper and of the Austrian state has always been a priority for the Führer, who now turns his eyes southward as Germany rises again.\n\nRather unfortunately, the government in Vienna does not share our view of things. Although we still maintain tense relations with them, the reality is that they are unlikely to peacefully accept any sort of unification of the Reich and her peoples - it would not be in the favour of the foreign masters! Along with this general hostility towards us, they have taken it upon themselves to crack down on the stormtroopers in their state who bravely fight for German freedom and unity.\n\nWith our turn towards a purified people’s revolution, the Valkist movement in Austria has fallen into disarray. While we both fight for a united greater Germany, they have certainly noticed our bloody path towards power and stubbornly cling on to old light by the misguided Dressler. While some conservatives have opened themselves up to us, the popularity of Valkism in Austria still remains low and few are terribly excited for the prospect of a united Germany.\n\nOut of this mess, Styrian brigade leader Konstantin Kammerhofer has taken the initiative to reach out to the Reich government. With a storied past radicalizing from the Heimwehr and fleeing to our Yugoslav friends before arriving back in Germany, Kammerhofer has gained much wind from the change of government, being among the first to declare loyalty to the new Germany after our takeover. Having curried enough favour to hold a direct meeting with the Führer and other leading men of the Reich, he requests that we re-focus our efforts on harbouring as many Stormtrooper refugees from the Austrian state as we can, Kammerhofer promises that once we take control of Austria, they are prepared to go all-out in pacifying the area and seeing it home to the Fatherland. Such a prospect certainly might not be very costly, though it could be a diversion of resources desperately needed elsewhere..."
gerflavor.3.a: "We have to do what we can..."
gerflavor.3.b: "Sadly, such a prospect is not possible."
gerflavor.3.tt: "§tOnce we take control of Austria, we will crush all resistance in the Austrian states, leaving them with the following state modifier and a starting compliance of §G5%§!.§!"

gerflavor.4.t: "Allies in Vienna?"
gerflavor.4.d: "If there is one goal that could unite every member of the Valkist coalition since the days of 1932, it would be the goal of a greater Germany. Whatever symbol they felt represented Germany best, the ultimate goal of the unification between the German peoples of Germany proper and of the Austrian state has always been a priority for the Führer, who now turns his eyes southward as Germany rises again.\n\nRather unfortunately, the government in Vienna does not share our view of things. Although we still maintain tense relations with them, the reality is that they are unlikely to peacefully accept any sort of unification of the Reich and her peoples - it would not be in the favour of the foreign masters! Along with this general hostility towards us, they have taken it upon themselves to crack down on the pan-German fighters in their state who bravely fight for German freedom and unity.\n\nWith the radical revolution envisioned by both valkist and stormtrooper averted, the pan-German forces in Austria too have seen a great uplift in their fortunes as support for a unified greater Germany has seen a noticeable uptick. Of course, this has also caused division within the preexisting Valkist movement in the Austrian state, with diehards in the movement causing trouble in both our relations with Vienna and in directing pan-German efforts in this construct of Versailles.\n\nStill, this division has not caused our efforts in Austria to be for naught. Desiring to see an end to this conflict, a letter has reached the desk of the Führer penned by influential officer Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. It pleads with us to cut all ties with the diehard Austrian valkists, and in turn pursue at least an initial phase of normalization of relations with Vienna. While he and many others absolutely agree with the goal of a unified greater Germany, such a thing should best be achieved without shots fired and with the revival of the Reich, it will be but a matter of time before the whole of the federal republic is clamoring to rejoin the fatherland. While many agree that the diehard Valkists have proved to be a burden, what would it say to the other radicals who have at least pragmatically aligned with us?"

gerdom.1.t: "The Fragile Order"
gerdom.1.d: "Despite Dressler’s popularity, many thought he would only serve as a temporary strongman who would step down once the communists and other leftist forces were suppressed. Dressler, however, used his time to cement his position in Germany. In 1935, he would begin the complete reorganization of the German state. But his work was hampered by the internal disunity of the Valkist movement. Dressler established the Reich Economic Chamber and the Reich’s Chamber of Valkism, while the Reichstag kept being a pseudo-parliament instead of the envisioned People's Chamber. Naturally, Dressler tried to ensure these new political entities would be packed only with his loyalists, but despite his best efforts, the political realities of the Valkist movement as a broad coalition and not a centralized nationalist power would prevent this.\n\nAt the end, three main factions crystallized themselves within the political framework of the Reich. The Young Conservatives, reformers, Christians, and dissident conservatives; the Völkisch National-Valkists, ethno-nationalists, and rural romantics, mainly represented by the TST; and Dresslers Valkist Orthodoxy So far, Dressler has been able to keep these three factions in check as Führer and mediator, but it becomes increasingly clear to Dressler and his men that their bickering and factionalism are hindering the Valkist project, and their support is increasingly redundant with Germany secure in the hands of the Führer and orthodox Valkism. A fact that the rivals of Valkist orthodoxy are keenly aware of."
gerdom.1.a: "Sieg Heil!"

gerdom.2.t: "The Plot"
gerdom.2.d: "Is Adam Dressler really up to the task of being the Führer? Of course, such a sentiment cannot be said out loud. If one truly knew what they were dealing with, they wouldn’t even THINK about saying such a thing in the public eye. How on earth could anyone question Führer Adam Dressler? The man who brought Germany out of the miserable and chaotic Weimar years? The man whose undying loyalty to Germany has brought us to where we are today?\n\nBut do not be fooled, the Führer is not as popular as he seems. This could be because the Führer has the right to his own opinion, and that opinion is one of Valkism. The name that denotes what the German Valkist Bloc is all about. Orthodox Valkism is revolutionary, seeking to make the Conservative Revolution a true revolution. Technophilic, sternly anti-capitalist and ultra-militaristic, the orthodox Valkists make their presence well known, buoyed especially well by the support of the Führer himself.\n\nThis is not to say that they are the most radical. The true radicals of the Valkist German Bloc are none other than the Völkisch National-Valkists. Led by Hermann Gauch and Viktor Lutze, their faith in biological racial ideas and total rejection of Christianity, combined with their rabid anti-semitism, prevalence of what can be best described as crackpot ideals and their extremely unruly nature has not made them the most well-liked faction in the block. Still, few can deny their effectiveness in cracking communist and liberal skulls alike and their love of the "Volk" makes them at least appear more wholesome compared to the heartless Valkist technocrats and domineering conservatives.\n\nBut with all of these radicals running all over Germany, who will bring order to the German people? The Young Conservatives of the Valkist German Bloc seek to pull their revolutionary allies down to earth. Their nucleus is the Edgar Jung Circle, a group of individuals behind the spread and discussion of such conservative ideas. For them, Germany suffers from the lack of organic and fundamental structures that can bring the German nation back to her rightful glory. Class conflict will be overcome, liberal ideas that divide man will be snuffed out and Germany will be whole in a federal, corporate state that would be much like a modern Holy Roman Empire.\n\nNaturally, such dreams are incompatible, and now it seems that whispers of conspiracies against the Führer are running amok..."

gerdom.3.t: "RSD Unconvers Bomb Plot"
gerdom.3.d: "Worrying news has come out that appears to show that shadowy elements in the Reich are plotting against Führer Adam Dressler! Recent intelligence indicates that there has been a plot to blow up a hall the Führer is scheduled to speak at. Such news has already proved divisive with both the TST and the Young Conservative movement decrying the other as the party responsible for such an unthinkable plan. How dare anybody even think of threatening the Führer’s rule? Naturally, we must dig deeper into this plot before we can determine who is truly responsible for this devious scheme, but until then, we must take all precautions necessary to protect Führer Adam Dressler."
gerdom.3.a: "Verrat!"

gerdom.4.t: "The Young Conservative Movement and the Reichswehr"
gerdom.4.d: "The Reichswehr and the Valkist regime have long had an icy relationship. Since the beginning of Dressler’s rise to power, the army and the Valkist party have not been on the best terms. Although the Reichswehr agrees with many of Dressler’s goals, they have never had anything positive to say about the national-revolutionaries that Dressler so eagerly accepts and empowers. Nevertheless, Dressler’s renewed focus on military expansion initially satiated the appetite of the Reichswehr.\n\nBut loyalty can only be bought for so long. Dressler is a power-hungry individual, a man who is determined to see his vision fulfilled. His party is made up of determined revolutionaries who desire to turn Germany upside down, a revolution from the right. For the Reichswehr, defenders of the old Prussian way, this attack on Germany is absolutely intolerable. How can the Führer be so willing to do away with everything Germany has stood for?\n\nThe frustration of the top Reichswehr generals have not gone unnoticed. With even the most enthusiastic among them like Ludwig Beck becoming disillusioned with the Valkist system, the Führer has only been able to make his best effort to appease and calm the people most crucial to Germany’s return to glory, though his fulfillment of these promises have not been to the liking of the Reichswehr. This has granted the Young Conservative movement, a haven of conservative and anti-Valkist thought a fertile ground for their malalignment. With the TST, packed to the brim with immature and excessively violent thugs and beasts on one end and the revolutionary Valkists, with heads full of grandeur and delusion of Germany becoming a revolutionary federal pan-European state, it appears that the sane, comparatively centrist Young Conservatives has become very appealing to the Reichswehr. Whilst their loyalty in times of war cannot be questioned, can they really be trusted to protect the Reich?\n\nBut of course! The Reichswehr are most certainly aware of the necessity of Führer Adam Dressler to save Germany. Prussian officers do not mutiny..."

gerdom.5.t: "Dressler's Speech"
gerdom.5.d: "The atmosphere is tense.\n\nFor a long time, tensions between the factions within the VDF have been simmering to an uncontrollable boil. Whether one is an dreamy Valkist, a radical TST member or a worried conservative, it is hard to deny that unity within the front has never been lower.\n\nAnd all for what? Petty divisions on the precise way Germany is to be saved from her state of misery? That would be what Führer Adam Dressler would say as he marches towards the podium. A simple speech that stresses the importance of unity within the front and of Germany would surely help to at least somewhat soothe tensions, no? That is all the Führer must do, as he is supposed to do, unite the Reich and her people into one cohesive mass, the only way in which Germany will be able to reclaim her glory.\n\nUnfortunately for him, the Führer does not seem to be as beloved as he would have hoped. Perhaps he made too few concessions? Maybe the reverse is true and he has failed to be harsh enough...\n\nEither way, it does not change the fact that the Führer is in danger. A bomb has been placed where Führer Adam Dressler plans to speak. For all of his political genius and devious maneuvering, it seems fate would have different plans for the Führer.\n\nOr does it? It seems that..."

In a surprising move, Führer Adam Dressler left before the bomb set off, enabling him to cheat death once more. To say that the Führer is apoplectic would be an understatement, as he has called for all divisions in the Reich to be ready on stand-by and for the RSD and Reichswehr to get to the bottom of the conspiracy against the Reich, with a state of emergency having been enacted. Already, the rabid TST are suspected of having acted against the Führer with Dressler himself ordering that his loyal Reichswehr move at once to neutralize the TST before they rise up.\n\nThe mood on the streets however do not give off the appearance of an emergency, life continues as before and many doubt that calling in the army is truly necessary to prevent any more attempts at the Führer’s life. Still, can we really enable conspirators to get away with attacking the Führer?"

gerdom.7.t: "Mobilization of the Reserve Army"
gerdom.7.d: "As soon as the order to neuter the TST came out, the army, ever so desperate to remove the radical threat, moved out. Commander of the Reserve Army, Joachim von Stülpnagel has ordered all TST divisions to surrender their arms, and has gone so far as to arrest many of their ringleaders. Reichsführer-TST Hermann Gauch has reportedly gone missing, with Lutze having retreated into Rhenish exile. A glorious victory for the Führer no doubt. A further demonstration of the army’s loyalty, their commitment to the Valkist cause.\n\nThis opportunity has also granted the Young Conservative movement the opportunity they have waited for so long. In spite of being led by military radical Joachim von Stülpnagel who aligns strongly with Dressler, the Reserve Army has been swayed by conservative elements. Known only to the highest ranking conservatives and generals, the Reserve Army has been tasked not just to neutralize the TST, but to create a new directory. This directorate would naturally be staffed by valkists, but also by the loyal generals and conservatives who gallantly came to the Führer’s aid.\n\nIn reality, this move will only cement the power of the Young Conservatives. Now, with the army out in full force, the Young Conservative movement will have the brute force necessary to secure power for themselves. And the Valkists? They will be too busy squabbling with one another over cooperation with the "reactionaries". For so long, the League has been forced to play third wheel in the volatile bloc. But no longer...\n\nDressler has fallen into their trap."

gerdom.8.d: "For all of their clever scheming and secret intrigue, the Young Conservatives have lost their gamble. Following the attempt on his life, Führer Adam Dressler immediately ordered that the plotters be rounded up and \"suggested\" to share who would lead them to such a heinous action. Soon enough, the TST plotters revealed the true nature of their crime. Agitated by the conservatives who up until then claimed that they were totally loyal to Germany and the Führer, they planted a bomb to kill the Führer for their own selfish gain.\n\nSuch a revelation has not been taken well. With the truth uncovered, it appears that the Führer’s life is now at risk from both the outraged TST and the treacherous conservatives. Rallying his loyal revolutionaries, Adam Dressler demanded that both the conservatives and the TST leadership be rounded up and tried, likely with the gallows being their fate.\n\nRefusing to remain idle until their certain doom, both the TST and the Young Conservatives have rallied their respective followers to their cause. With all sides declaring themselves the legitimate government and soldiers on the streets and in the barracks mobilizing, there can be no more denial.\n\nGermany has entered civil war."

With the unity of the bloc and hence Germany at great risk, the Führer has decided to take action to calm tensions within the bloc. How can Germany throw off the shackles of Paris without being united? Negotiations have already begun, with the deal being that both the conservatives and the TST temper their radicals, and that they all follow in lockstep with the Führer until Germany has won her war.\n\nOf course, such a deal can only benefit the TST, who take an active role in running the country compared to the doddering and infirm conservatives who remain locked in meaningless, banal or weak positions that cannot be weaponized against the Führer.

Government officials that resisted have been reported to be jailed or in some instances, killed.\n\nIn Berlin, the oncoming putsch was discovered by loyal Valkist citizens who hurriedly reported the oncoming attempt before Berlin was totally closed off. Led by Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, the TST began to close the streets of Berlin, blocking entrances into the city and encircling the chancellery. Luckily, the ensuing chaos enabled most of the Valkist leadership including von Salomon, Wagener, Scheringer and Paetel to escape. However, the Führer seemingly began to depart too late as he is now trapped in the city.\n\nWith the Führer and hence Germany’s fate lies at stake, it appears that Germany is about to fall into complete pandemonium.

As it appears that a second march on Berlin has occurred, it now lies on none other than Führer Adam Dressler to determine the fate of Germany. As the TST approaches the chancellery, no doubt in an attempt to take his life, there lies some options for him to escape the situation that he has been forced into.\n\nOne option is to order the guards in the chancellery to simply shoot anyone who attempts to enter the chancellery, such an action would probably start a fight that he would lose, but this would grant him the opportunity to escape or even the time for his loyal Reichswehr to finally finish off the zealots of the TST.\n\nAnother option is to request the aid of the Young Conservative movement. If there is only one thing they can agree on, it is that the proletarian völkisch fools who run the TST must be contained at all costs. Their intervention would most definitely impede any TST attempt at taking total control...although this would likely end any chance for Valkism to truly spread across Germany.\n\nLastly, Dressler could simply order the guards to proceed as usual and arrest those who attempt to enter the chancellery without permit. In the meanwhile, he could rally on the loyal valkists of Berlin to throw off the revolters and restore order to Berlin. Even though this would hopefully prevent any violence until he is ready, can he really count on being able to rally the people of Berlin to his side for long enough? As the TST closes in, they appear to be united and unstoppable, determined to kill him and the Reich with it.\n\nStill, Dressler remains in the Chancellery and with him his supporters.

Although Dressler himself is unharmed, it is doubtful that he will remain unharmed for much longer at this rate. With the TST successfully breaching the front of the Chancellery, it now lies on the Führer to decide his next step. After all, resisting the TST was only a temporary sacrifice necessary to allow him to escape to Munich where Valkism will grant Germany her rebirth by fire.\n\nOr perhaps he could rally his supporters in Berlin? With the TST at the gate, even a simple radio announcement would be better than fleeing with his tail between his legs. At the very least, the paltry crew that would be annihilated by the TST could buy time for the army to save him. Still, there is not much time to ponder what to do next, what is our next move?"

Yet, as TST guards patrol the chancellery and the streets of Berlin, it seems that the Führer is nowhere to be found.\n\nBut how? He was in the TST’s grasp! Could it be the fault of an unaware guard? Maybe there was simply something they missed when breaching the chancellery? Or perhaps the Führer is truly dead? By the end of the day however, the TST found out the truth.

Their failure to secure the Führer has only served to weaken their momentum as local militias either overrun or push back their brigades that faced setbacks as soon as the putsch was underway. No doubt traitors were responsible for their failures, but there is now no time to assign blame.\n\nAs Germany realizes the magnitude of their putsch, it is apparent that civil war is on the horizon like the sun rising in the morning. Setting up a provisional government in Munich, Adam Dressler has denounced both the TST and the Young Conservative movement, with the traitorous TST being enabled by the nefarious League in their attempt to destroy Germany and put her back in the stone age, leaving her subject to the whims of greater European powers. In response, the conservatives have split off, creating their own government that proclaims itself as the only government that can resist revolutionary terror and violent oppression by the Valkists and the TST.

gerdom.18.d: "Fate has not been kind to Adam Dressler thus far. The recently established directory has only isolated Dressler more and more from real power in Berlin. Ravenous wolves and vile serpents in the shape of humans stalk Berlin as Valkism becomes less and less relevant and more and more of a pipe dream. Every day, he is paraded out in a sick show of "loyalty" as traitors surround him and his loyal followers are kicked out and abused by the bastards he had so stupidly worked with to save Germany.\n\nFührer Adam Dressler may be named as the Führer, but the truth is that his Valkist dream is over. The Conservative Revolution has failed, or so he thinks. Over the coming days, the Führer’s health has become worse, mentally and physically.\n\nYet in a shocking discovery, it was found that the Führer is dead. Whilst many suspect a culprit, few even know where one may be. A state funeral of the most lavish kind has been called, and Führer Adam Dressler will be remembered..."
dressler_death_reply_valkist: "...as the Führer all Germans aspire to be."
dressler_death_reply_natpops: "...as an misled, moderate fool."
dressler_death_reply_youngcs: "...as a hopelessly delusional revolutionary."

gerdom.19.t: "The Legacy of Valkism"
gerdom.19.d: "As the German people from Karlsruhe to Königsberg mourn the death of the Führer, it now lies upon his successors to decide whom to support. The death of Dressler has struck a severe and perhaps even irrecoverable blow to the national-revolutionaries, serving only to weaken their grip more as more of their supporters and ideologues are retired, jailed or even murdered at random.\n\nTo consolidate themselves, the Valkists have opted to call a conference, led by Ernst von Salomon to decide their next move. Should they attempt to break from any cooperation with the traitors of the Führer’s will or should they simply follow as the Führer had been doing so under the directory? With the prospect of a Valkist Germany now seeming laughably unlikely and their conference being stringently spied upon by their enemies, the mood within the conference area was anything but optimistic. In a resigned tone, von Salomon accepted that the Valkists of Germany are now left without hope of a peaceful takeover and that the only option is to throw whatever weight they have left behind either the TST or the Young Conservative movement.\n\nSuch a sentiment has already caused a major ruckus within the conference as Paetel has denounced any cooperation with the people who betrayed the Führer following fabrications and machinations designed to cheat Germany out of her salvation. With the future of Valkism looking bleak, the Valkists can only wonder.\n\nWhat would the Führer do?"
gerdom.19.a: "The Führer would not have picked his poison..."
gerdom.19.b: "The Führer would choose sanity..."
gerdom.19.c: "The Führer would take radical action..."

gerdom.20.t: "The German Civil War"
gerdom.20.d: "The death of Führer Adam Dressler was bound to have severe consequences on all of Germany. The recently established directory has only revealed the true colors of the TST and the Young Germans as they battle for dominance in the military, in the economy and even in the streets. With a deadlock having been reached in the entire German government, it was bound that something had to give.\n\nThe refusal of the Valkists to cooperate with any side has only isolated them further from the government, but has also in a twist rallied more people around them. As the government becomes more and more fractured, the German people have also become more divided. With their apparent purge creeping ever closer and closer, the Valkists fired the first shot, proclaiming a provisional government led by Ernst von Salomon and calling on the German people to ‘overthrow the reactionaries’ in a national revolution.\n\nThe failure of both the TST and the Young Conservatives to predict such a move has only completed the separation between both factions in the directory. Not long after the Valkist rebellion, the TST split off from the directory, calling on their loyal supporters to crush both the feeble government and the ‘Bolsheviks’. With their gambit having failed, the Young Conservatives have now been left to pick up the pieces, calling on all factions to surrender as Dressler’s nightmare becomes reality.\n\nGermany has fallen into civil war."

gerdom.21.t: "Ride of the Valkyries"
gerdom.21.d: "As militias rose throughout Berlin, von Helldorff found himself in an extremely disastrous situation. He had not expected militias, poorly trained as they may be, to obstruct his units and fight back against the TST who were initially not expecting any resistance. As the firefights raged throughout Berlin, the TST were driven back from the chancellery. Finally, Dressler’s hope of martial intervention arrived.\n\nAn admirer of Dressler’s desire for a totalitarian state and believing that such a state is the only way to repudiate the disgrace of Versailles, Minister of War Werner von Blomberg has opted to display his loyalty to the Führer, calling on army units to respond to the Führer’s call for help from Berlin. Soon enough, von Helldorff was arrested and the TST units in Berlin either surrendered to or committed suicide in the face of military intervention by the Reichswehr. With the Reichswehr having saved him in Berlin, Dressler has successfully avoided the disaster that seemed to loom all over Germany. As Reichswehr units throughout Germany put down the TST revolt, it is undeniable that the army has once again saved the day for Germany and frankly the entire world."
gerdom.21.a: "Gott mit uns!"

gerdom.22.t: "End of the Civil War"
gerdom.22.d: "After enduring a challenging couple of months, our Great Deutsch's Vaterland has finally reunited under a single banner—our own. As we stand united, we look forward to shaping the future of a new Deutschland. Together, we are poised to embark on a journey that holds the promise of prosperity, unity, and progress for our nation.\n\nBut that is in the future. For now, Germany lies in ruin, with most of her major cities wrecked by the traitors who were willing to throw our Fatherland into the fiery pits of war. Every branch of the state, even the vaunted Heer have undergone severe trauma, with purges and reorganization occurring at every level. Whilst we rebuild, our foes continue to reform and build up as they overcome their struggles. Now, not merely the most pessimistic of us will wonder..."
gerdom.22.a: "Much remains ahead of us..."

gerdom.23.t: "Filling The Void"
gerdom.23.d: "The position of Chancellor has been vacant since the great reconstruction in 1932. The infamous last Chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher, has tainted the position with the stench of treason, and for some time, it was even debated if we should get rid of the position altogether. Dressler, however, was firmly opposed to this. Since then, the Chancellorship has been vacant.\n\nSince 1934, Rudolf Jung has faithfully served as interim Chancellor, being the right-hand man of Dressler and leader of the Reich Chamber of Valkism. This arrangement, however, was never meant to be permanent and is now at an end. Recent events have shown that the current arrangement cannot continue. The empty position serves as a dangerous power vacuum, and the government is less effective because of it. Our advisors have pointed out, however, that any appointment will strengthen the political faction of said candidate tremendously within the Chambers of the Reich while upsetting the others, demonstrating that factionalism is another reason the position has remained empty for so long.\n\nSo far, there are two main candidates for the job that most Orthodox Valkists and quite a few within the other factions can agree upon. Fritz Kloppe with his unique idea of Possedism or Karl Otto Paetel and his radical revolutionary ideas. Both men were early supporters of Valkism, and both men have a great personal connection to Dressler. With the permission of the Führer, the first vote for the Chancellorship will begin, but ultimately it is up to Dressler whose appointment he will confirm."
gerdom.23.a: "Kloppe is the man for the job."
gerdom.23.b: "Paetel will move Germany forward!"

gerdom.24.t: "[This.GetName] Appointed as Interim Chancellor"
gerdom.24.d: "With Germany having fallen into civil war, certain cabinet ministers have revealed their true colors, opting to defect and betray the fatherland. With the Valkist movement facing its greatest challenge yet, Richard Scheringer has been chosen by the rump Reich Chamber of Valkism as the new interim Chancellor.\n\nA reliable and competent fighter for the Valkist cause, Scheringer’s appointment will surely bring stability and confidence back to our administration, especially when his origins are taken into account. Our newspapers and broadcasting stations will publicly announce the decision this evening to the German people."
gerdom.24.a: "We will not further dilute our revolution!"

Our continued crusade for justice appears to have led to these companies creating evacuation plans to smuggle key personnel and documents out of the country. Among their treasures are blueprints for machinery, patents and experts in various scientific fields.\n\nWhilst this may be a severe blow to our current industrial and technical capabilities, we need not worry much.

gerdom.26.t: "German Companies Relocated in our Territory"
gerdom.26.d.kiel: "With Germany falling further into revolutionary madness, refugees have begun fleeing across the border. Among them are several industrialists and scientists. The increasingly unfriendly nature of the government towards German companies have led to these companies creating evacuation plans to smuggle key personnel and documents out of the country. Among their treasures are blueprints for machinery, patents and experts in various scientific fields.\n\nWhilst the Kiel government may not be the most suitable place for companies to operate, its connections with British finance and trade has enticed many companies to move for the connections, especially marine organizations which have a great deal of connections with the Kiel naval base."

The increasingly unfriendly nature of the government towards German companies have led to these companies creating evacuation plans to smuggle key personnel and documents out of the country.

Although more nationalist-minded corporations may be disquieted by working with French overlords, many have decided that Germany is simply far too revolutionary for any further cooperation."
gerdom.26.a: "A boon perhaps?"

gerdom.27.t: "[This.GetName] Forms a Cabinet"
gerdom.27.d: "With the Führer’s blessing, [This.GetName] has formed a new cabinet that is to now take the reins of state. While many had thought that the Führer would have picked a much more pliable candidate than [This.GetName], it appears that the Führer desires to take a lighter hand in managing the affairs of Germany and most especially when it comes to the economy where [This.GetName] has the most influence."
gerdom.27.a: "We warmly welcome him!"

gerdom.28.t: "Companies File For Bankruptcy"
gerdom.28.d: "It appears that our new policies have shook much of German business to the core. As the state now takes over many businesses, many business leaders have complained to the Führer about the extremely poor financial outlook that many of them were facing as weeks turned into months. Now it seems this has come back to bite us as corporations, big and small alike, begin to file for bankruptcy. While this has yet to affect the largest companies of the Reich, it has served to instill, rather unfortunately too, a negative image of the government amongst the middle-class of Germany."
gerdom.28.a: "Bah!"

gerdom.29.t: "A Satisfying Investigation"
gerdom.29.d: "Not only did we uncover personal connections and comprehensive membership lists, we also managed to uncover some very damning evidence on certain members within their circles, reaching the highest level of leadership. It looks like we won't even have to use extraordinary government force in the coming proceedings; what we found truly speaks for itself. We will still hold a trial for propaganda purposes. They are going to have a field day."
gerdom.29.a: "This will be a short trial."

gerdom.30.t: "Expected Revelations"
gerdom.30.d: "Our recent raids on the conservative gentleman clubs uncovered some damning evidence of treasonous activities. We found connections to certain industrialists and foreign elements that warrant further investigation. At best, this is another case of corruption aimed against our economic remodeling; at worst, we uncovered a money scheme to fund seditious elements. Unfortunately, the evidence we did gather has not led to any concrete names yet."
gerdom.30.a: "We just have to continue following the money..."

gerdom.31.t: "For Want of Dirt"
gerdom.31.d: "Despite our recent well-funded large-scale raids on the conservative gentleman's clubs aimed at uncovering evidence for the treasonous activities of our political rivals, our man came back empty-handed. Either someone tipped them off, or they managed to hide their operations better than we thought. All the people we checked and all the locations we searched were completely clean, to an almost suspicious degree. Not even a single mark of missed tax payments.\n\nNothing.\n\nTo add insult to injury, one of our eager men accidentally shot a conservative veteran of the Royal Deployment in Potsdam, fueling outrage against this blunder. Even within our own ranks, people have begun to demand that Walther Stennes, who led the operation, step down from his position, surely all hoping to become his successor."
gerdom.31.a: "Let them talk, this will soon blow over."

gerdom.32.t: "Scandal in the Bureaucracy"
gerdom.32.d: "Almost by accident, one of our bureaucrats within the economic ministry stumbled over what appeared to be a bookkeeping error. Upon further investigation, it turns out that the assumed simple error was part of a scheme to embezzle government funds for personal projects and bribery at high levels of the local administrative apparatus. It looks like even some members of our movement were involved in this, resulting in a small but steady stream of money flowing into private pockets for months, if not years. It looks like many of those officials who took part in this scheme did not even do so knowingly but simply assumed the money was for another one of our projects. With the chaos resulting from our administrative restructuring after 1933, many such schemes were created, but this one is extraordinarily large, according to some of our investigators. Despite our best efforts, the news has already reached the broad public, an embarrassing failure for our government."
gerdom.32.a: "It looks like a thorough purge is in order."

gerdom.33.t: "Cooperation of the Elites"
gerdom.33.d: "It seems that our overtures to the elites of Germany, especially in the financial and business sector have turned out to be a resounding success. With the aid of Valkist-aligned industrial elites led by Georg Keppler, a personal oath of loyalty has come about signed by many of Germany’s highest ranking industrialists and financiers, with the signatures of Gustav Krupp and Hjalmar Schacht especially standing out. It seems that even the plutocrats of old Germany have the ability to come around."
gerdom.33.a: "Wunderbar!"

gerdom.34.t: "A Wealth of Ambivalence"
gerdom.34.d: "In a totally unexpected turn of events that absolutely nobody could have possibly foreseen, the response to our overtures towards the capitalist elites of old Germany have been mixed. While they have promised to cooperate with the government in industrial and foreign policy, they have been worryingly tight-lipped on the prospect of full-on cooperation and liaisons between the industrial and finance sector have been limited. We can only take this as a sign that we have much work ahead of us..."
gerdom.34.a: "As if we could expect much else..."

gerdom.35.t: "Capitalist Betrayal"
gerdom.35.d: "In an expected move by the plutocrats of Germany, a letter co-written by representatives of the Reichsbank as well as Dresdner Bank and Reich Industry Group has reached the Führer. In it, they implore the Führer to reconsider his supposed \"turn towards Bolshevism\" by requesting that our recent economic policies in favour of the German people be lifted to let them exploit more for their own gain. While they disguise this as \"rationalisation\" and \"efficiency\", we see the truth. While we have yet to muster a proper plan to be rid of them, these magnates will soon experience their downfall!"

gerdom.36.t: "The Constitutional Convention"
gerdom.36.d: "As Valkism continues to entrench itself in Germany and abroad, the time has come for us to do away entirely with the wretched old constitution. While this may seem hasty with the supposedly acceptable state bureaucracy, the Führer has decreed that the Valkist revolution cannot proceed without a proper Valkist state.\n\nTo this end, a grand conference in Munich has been called. With every single minister and leader standing at attention to none other than the Führer himself, the hall would erupt in shouts of \"Heil Dressler\" and \"Führer befiehl, wir folgen dir\" as the Valkist Constitutional Convention was commenced."
gerdom.36.a: "We have come so far!"

gerdom.37.t: "The Brains Behind the Revolution"
gerdom.37.d: "With the opening of the constitutional convention, much buzz has been made about the influence of the Valkist thinkers on this new constitution. After all, what sort of Valkist constitution would this be without the brains behind the ideology of Valkism? However, as more fringe activists and writers such as Herbert Blank and Lothar Erdmann spoke up - some more conservative Valkists have raised their objections.\n\nTheir caution has come from a place of pragmatism, for if we indulge the intellectuals too much, it is very likely that we will lose the support of the business who we already share a rather tenuous relationship with. If we are to make this a worthy constitution, surely it should protect all Germans rather than simply a narrow selection regardless if they are rich or poor - right?"
gerdom.37.a: "Bring them in - no restraint needed!"
gerdom.37.b: "Let us not bind ourselves too much..."

gerdom.38.t: "The Head of the Convention"
gerdom.38.d: "As the convention begins to take form, many have pointed out the lack of a head to direct the convention in the right places. Already, much time has been wasted on discussions of new heraldry, the use of specific lyrics and other relatively meaningless details compared to the massive questions that must be definitively answered. To this end, Carl Schmitt has been raised as the potential head of the convention, with his brilliant theories on political and judicial matters shaping greatly the Valkist world-view. Additionally, his relatively non-partisan status due to his unwillingness to throw in entirely with the VDF has induced relief in more conservative circles of Germany.\n\nOn the other hand, his appointment as the presider of the convention would certainly induce hostile reactions resulting from the widespread völkisch sentiment across the Reich as well as within the VDF itself. While Schmitt is no progressive, accusations that he is too legalistic and lacks focus on the warrior nature of Germany have also come out along with the age-old accusation of his work not being racially-inspired enough. As such, a much less controversial though perhaps generic pick may be Ernst von Salomon, a well-acclaimed writer and Valkist leader, boosted further by his history as both a Valkist stalwart who will ensure that the Valkist convention comes to a roaring conclusion."
gerdom.38.a: "Let us give Schmitt the welcome worthy of a true Valkist genius!"
gerdom.38.b: "He does not have the guts necessary - invite Salomon."

gerdom.39.t: "The Mistakes of the Past"
gerdom.39.d: "The old Weimar constitution was undoubtedly far too democratic and liberal in its provisions. This much can be universally agreed upon by all relevant forces in the Reich, yet another question has crept into the convention as a result. After all, both the old system and today’s Reich hail from the same laws and bear the same official name. While we have changed some laws and enforced additional laws, the reality is that we still share much of our legal code with the old Weimar state.\n\nTo this end, Carl Schmitt along with other leading Valkist jurists and thinkers have drawn up a new constitution, enshrining the Führerprinzip along with many other true Valkist principles. The old Weimar system would at last be totally extirpated from Germany, all of its vestiges gone as the revived Reich rises from the ashes. However, many conservatives in the Valkist movement as well as the allying organizations surrounding the VDF have raised objections. Besides typical conservative fear-mongering of any sort of revolution, some point out that the Weimar constitution has worked well in helping us to achieve our goals and that changing it would be to invite upheaval just as Germany faces its greatest crisis yet in the form of a war with the global Entente order."
gerdom.39.a: "The Weimar state is derelict - its foundations too."
gerdom.39.b: "It would be totally wasteful to abandon it entirely!"

gerdom.40.t: "The Führer’s Thoughts"
gerdom.40.d: "While he may not be officially presiding over the convention, there is little doubt that the Führer and destined leader of Germany Adam Dressler is the core man in the formulation of the Valkist constitution. How else could we have begun such a project were it not for the Führer’s blessing? As such, Dressler’s own thoughts and writings have determined the direction of the convention greatly.\n\nMost influential has been Dressler’s magnum opus - \"Der Arbeiter. Herrschaft und Gestalt\" where Dressler advocates for a total renewal of society beyond class lines along the lines of a spiritual awakening and technological revolution. This is key to the Valkist world-view and while it may outrage outsiders of the Valkist movement, we all shall hold on to it until the end!"
gerdom.40.dressler_dead: "While he may not be officially presiding over the convention, there is little doubt that the martyred Führer of Germany Adam Dressler is the core man in the formulation of the Valkist constitution. How else could we have begun such a project were it not indicated as one of the Führer’s great goals? As such, Dressler’s own thoughts and writings have determined the direction of the convention greatly.\n\nMost influential has been Dressler’s magnum opus - \"Der Arbeiter. Herrschaft und Gestalt\" where Dressler advocates for a total renewal of society beyond class lines along the lines of a spiritual awakening and technological revolution. This is key to the Valkist world-view and while it may outrage outsiders of the Valkist movement, we all shall hold on to it until the end!\n\nAt least that would be the case were he still around. With Dressler’s martyrdom, the outlook of the Valkist revolution has never been so grim yet so diverse. Competing views of the future and interpretation of Dressler’s own works vary greatly and hence some urge that we simply enshrine his writings and teachings into the constitution as the martyred Führer deserves rather than trying to interpret directly that which only he, the Valkist genius, could possibly comprehend."
gerdom.40.a: "He is our light - der Führer Adam Dressler!"
gerdom.40.b: "He watches over Germany - and we carry his legacy!"

gerdom.41.t: "Rudolf Jung"
gerdom.41.d: "As the convention continues on, the status of the Reichsvolkskammer and Reichswirtschaftskammer have surprisingly remained rather steady throughout. After all, these entities exist as Valkist institutions that serve as the foundations for the new Valkist republic to work upon and their roles are key in fulfilling the Valkist cultural revolution. The question however has now turned towards the man behind these institutions and many of the principles of Valkism - as well as former interim-chancellor Rudolf Jung.\n\nAcquainted with Dressler since their shared days in German Bohemia, Jung and Dressler’s relationship would slowly begin to deteriorate in an unfortunate turn of events as Dressler moved closer to radicals such as Paetel and von Salomon. Unlike Dressler, Jung has remained since the Habsburg days a virulent antisemite and völkisch activist. While he is a Valkist, his view of Valkism is far away from the typical conception of the ideology, believing the Jew as well as their puppets in capitalism and Marxism deny Germany her rightful destiny of glorious expansion and ultimate freedom.\n\nThis has resulted in a drifting apart of the two men, with the new convention now causing the question of Jung’s status to come to a head. Should he be recognized and considered a prime Valkist intellectual? His valuable contributions must be remembered, but his modern affiliation with the TST and other völkisch elements in the Reich have already served to stain his record."
gerdom.41.a: "To him, much is owed."
gerdom.41.b: "He is but a faded and extremely racist star."

gerdom.42.t: "A Consensus?"
gerdom.42.d: "While we continue to construct a new constitution for the Valkist state, many observers have noted that the main figures present at the head of the creation of a new Valkist state are mainly intellectuals, writers and publicists of all stripes. Rather lacking are the men who see to every aspect of Germany’s revival - whether they be major ministers like the Reichsminister of Finance or minor roles such as the Reichsminister of Forestry.\n\nAs the executors of Valkist policies in the Reich, the more pragmatic leaders of the Valkist movement have called for us to bring them in to address and deal with the constitution as well to ensure proper vetting of it by those who might surely know best how Germany ought to achieve Valkist transformation. On the other hand, many radicals do not believe that the ministers are worth much when compared to the will of the Führer and that any consensus would be a waste of time and distraction for the ministers whose main goal ought to be executing the Führer’s will."
gerdom.42.a: "The ministers must at least be consulted!"
gerdom.42.b: "There is no need for such a thing - the Führer will figure it out!"

gerdom.43.t: "The Chancellor’s View"
gerdom.43.d: "The position of Chancellor has always been an acclaimed one in Germany, acting essentially as the premier statesman in Germany. While there have always been chiefs above the chancellor, few could ever not afford much attention to what the chancellor had to say. This question has now become rather pertinent as the construction of the Valkist state continues.\n\nIt is true that the Führer is the man who will save Germany, destined by fate. Yet it is also true that no man can rule entirely alone. As chief Valkist jurists have ruled it, the Führer in many ways acts as an empowered president of the Reich rather than a Tartar lord who rules without question. As such, some have urged that we bring the chancellor in not just to state his piece, but to supervise and ensure that the constitution acts in Germany’s interests."
gerdom.43.a: "The chancellor may make his own views heard."
gerdom.43.b: "We should listen keenly to what he has to say."

gerdom.44.t: "Securing Support"
gerdom.44.d: "Despite our best attempts to make an all-encompassing and thorough constitution superior to its liberal counterparts, the reality is that the current draft of the Valkist constitution still remains accepted only by the Valkist faithful and those too afraid to oppose the Reich. With a bureaucracy that holds great inertia when facing the prospect of Valkist constitutional reform, many are beginning to fear that this convention will be for naught.\n\nWhile the Führer has thankfully allayed fears of rejection by promising to force the new constitution into being, some have urged that we prepare to make concessions in the wording of specific items as well as adding exceptions for other groups. Revolutionary ideas on the role of the sexes as well as the nature of the German people are on the chopping block as well, making radicals nervous that attempts to shore up support will simply result in a watered down piece of paper."
gerdom.44.a: "All available means at our disposal shall be taken!"
gerdom.44.b: "Let us not rock the boat too much..."

gerdom.45.t: "The Bastion of Reaction"
gerdom.45.d: "Where does the military stand? In the Valkist state envisioned by the movement, the military will not merely be an arm for the Valkist civilization to-be. Instead, it shall serve as one of the vital pillars of Valkist society, with every man expected to join the military and serve with distinction as war equalizes and revitalizes every individual’s spirit.\n\nOf course, things are not so simple. The military is vital to our plans for the rebirth of the German nation and her rightful place in the world. As such, demanding their total obedience has not proven terribly popular in the more conservative Valkist circles, let alone the military itself. Still, do they not serve the Führer with all their soul?"
gerdom.45.a: "Leave them to their own devices - for now..."
gerdom.45.b: "The military shall be made to kneel."

gerdom.46.t: "The Price of Progress"
gerdom.46.d: "As the convention rolls on, a rather dismal mood has begun to set in. After all, so much talk has yet to result in a proper implementation of the constitution. Furthermore, whispers of corruption have greatly increased to such an extent that they can barely be described as whispers anymore. Many ambitious and self-serving \"Valkists\" see this as their opportunity, it seems, to make themselves rich with the granting of leadership roles.\n\nWhile bribery of such leaders has not been taken well by the younger and generally scrappier members of the Valkist movement, the Alter Kämpfer have pressed for their advancement at every level of society. From key positions in government offices to unimportant positions in cultural centers, the ‘old fighters’ of Valkism have demanded that they be rewarded for their faith and dedication - putting us in a bind."
gerdom.46.a: "Bribery is simply part of this game."
gerdom.46.b: "Never!"

gerdom.47.t: "Defence of the Valkist Reich"
gerdom.47.d: "When it comes to the most threatening forces to the new Germany, many such forces can trace themselves to the German people’s age-old enemies. Whichever nation’s tune they dance to, whether it be Paris, Rome or Moscow, they still rear their ugly selves in Germany. Reports on the cowardly communists are frequent, and reports of treacherous priests moreso.\n\nTo deal with these enemies, the constitution has already set aside major powers, both traditionally Prussian and also new, to ensure that none can threaten the security of the Volk and of Valkism. A new service too, the Reichssicherheitsdienst has been established. Yet, members of the Valkist movement have already come to blows as to how it shall be employed. Should it simply ensure that no major uproar occurs? Or perhaps it ought to take a supervisory role in society? Such a question can only be resolved by the Führer."
gerdom.47.a: "With prejudice, they shall be found and crushed!"
gerdom.47.b: "We should not interfere unduly into the average German’s life."
gerdom.47.tt: "The old §gAbwehr§! shall be merged with the security services, creating the §7Reichssicherheitsdienst§!"

gerdom.48.t: "The New Valkist Constitution"
gerdom.48.d: "Finally, the convention has come to a consensus. Elements, vital or not, have been stripped and added to the constitution such that few could even recognize the connection between the first drafts and the final one presented to the Reichsvolkskammer. Presided by Volkskammer president Paul Tafel, the new constitution would soon face a vote.\n\nDespite being defunct, the old Weimar constitution is still legally in place. Hence, a new constitution was needed, one that would solidify the Valkist ideology as a pillar of German society, creating a state motivated not by ignominious bureaucracy nor oligarchic parties. As such, the deputies would soon cast their votes resoundingly in favour of the new constitution, so much so that it was a unanimous decision to replace the old constitution.\n\nNow it came the Führer’s turn to witness the new constitution. Naturally, the Führer in his genius was able to parse through the document in no time, comprehending immediately and in such a brilliant manner the new order that was to come. At last, Germany is free of liberal tyranny!"
gerdom.48.a: "Vorwärts!"

gerdom.49.t: "The Status of the TST"
gerdom.49.d: "With Valkism now firmly entrenched into German society, the difficult questions of Valkist organization may now begin with little difficulty. One such question is the status of the Trutzbündische Stoßtruppe - the armed wing of the Valkist movement. Formed at the birth of the VDFb, the Stormtroopers acted to ensure that no communists nor republican thugs could harm the many enlightened innocents within our movement without expecting disproportionate retaliation. As armed bands donning green shirts marched down the streets of Munich, Berlin and Frankfurt, the enemies of the Valkist movement fled as the people rallied to the call of the Führer!\n\nSuch romantic days however are long past us. Following the takeover, our integration of the Valkist movement into German society was admittedly rather sloppy, with the outcome being that the Stormtroopers began to degenerate. Far from becoming any sort of rival to the army as feared, the TST would soon begin to experience a near-catastrophic downsizing that threatened to rip apart all the infrastructure built around the organization. Perhaps worst of all, the TST would soon become rife with extreme völkisch tendencies, receiving support from the most reactionary and racist of plutocrats. With the treacherous Reichsführer Hermann Gauch at their head, the Stormtroopers, although now defanged, remain a potent threat to the stability of the Reich.\n\nTo solve this, some have urged that we grant the Stormtroopers a national role. Rather than simply leaving them with nothing productive to do beyond acting as a handmaiden for the military, we could turn them into a sort of reserve unit where the most dedicated Valkists join to serve the Führer and Germany more faithfully. On the other hand, many more technocratic and conservative elements in the Valkist movement have called for it to be merged into either the military or police forces and thereby strengthen the Valkist grip on either institution."
gerdom.49.a: "Create a TST reserve militia."
gerdom.49.b: "Fully integrate it into the army."
gerdom.49.c: "Fully integrate it into the police force."

gerdom.50.t: "The End of the Young German Order"
gerdom.50.d: "The decision for the Stormtroopers to tentatively agree to compromise with the Valkist movements has ruffled some feathers to say the least. Outrage has erupted from the Young Conservatives and especially Jungdo, with a flurry of threats and condemnations flooding the Fführer’s office. Reichsführer Gauch now even finds his life under threat as assassination attempts abound by furious renegades backed by desperate Young Conservatives.\n\nThis has granted the Valkist movement the opportunity it has always desired. While the racist fantasies of the modern TST are distasteful, the most dangerous wing of the Valkist movement, the reactionary and treacherous Young Conservatives have now given the Führer a good reason to secure his power. In the wake of another attempted assassination on the Reichsführer-TST, a conference of all leading Stormtroopers and Valkists was called. As Führer Dressler commanded, they would meet in Munich - home of the national revolution. Here, it was agreed - it was time for the Young Conservative rot to be exorcised.\n\nWhen the order came out, Valkists and Jungdo members would begin to fight in the street, with the Stormtroopers subsequently brutalizing many suspected of Young Conservative allegiance. Realizing the changing situation, the Reichswehr have resworn loyalty to the Führer. Finally, the Stormtroopers took it upon themselves to execute those who had betrayed Germany, with Edgar Jung, Artur Mahraun and other plutocrats being summarily executed as part of the new order. Following the dissolution of Jungdo and all other adjacent Young Conservative organizations, a new diarchy between the original two poles of the Valkist movement has arrived, and shall now herald a new future - a future where Germany comes out victorious or dies trying."
gerdom.50.a: "The new order in Germany is here..."

gerdom.51.t: "End of the Kirchenkampf"
gerdom.51.d: "As we gear up for the next phase of Germany’s revival, the truth has become clear.\n\nFrom the outset, our greatest enemy was the Church. Whether they took form as Roman puppets or as weak-minded dissenters, the Churches in all their forms opposed us when we took power in 1932 and up until now their insolence has brought nothing but annoyance and difficulty to our revolution. In our attempt to subdue them, it was rather obvious that many challenges were had and ultimately, the clergy have successfully escaped our grip as the average German finds little change in their spiritual consumption.\n\nBut not all are disappointed. While we may have failed to subdue the Church in our crusade for Germany, their hostility to us has been massively suppressed. Clergy members now do not dare to speak much more than passive words of displeasure at our government as we continue to move Germany into a new age. Once Germany is secure from all outside forces, we will be free to once again continue this struggle, but for now..."

gerdom.52.d: "As we gear up for the next phase of Germany’s revival, the truth has become clear.\n\nFrom the outset, our greatest enemy was the Church. Whether they took form as Roman puppets or as weak-minded dissenters, the Churches in all their forms opposed us when we took power in 1932 and up until now their insolence has brought nothing but annoyance and difficulty to our revolution. In our attempt to subdue them, we surprisingly met with great success. Our bid for spiritual dominance now undeniably reigns supreme - doing once again what the Kaiserreich under Bismarck failed to do decades ago.\n\nWith the old churches receding further and further into the background, the way forward for Germany is now set. No longer shall the primitive values of mercy, kindness nor any other supposed \"ethic\" prevent the German people from doing what is necessary. The brave sons of Germania now march inexorably towards a new age, one where not only is the Reich reigns supreme, but so too does the front that led us here."

In our attempt to subdue them, it was rather obvious that many challenges were had.\n\nSo many challenges in fact that we have had no choice but to end this struggle.\n\nThis is no doubt a crippling blow to the social revolution that we have hoped to undertake in Germany. With the churches now more emboldened than ever to resist the government, some even speak of a retribution greater than that of Sodom upon Germany as we evaluate what our next step shall be."

gerdom.54.d: "If there was one thing that the Valkist coalition could agree on, whether they were a stormtrooper from rural Bavaria, a Valkist bureaucrat in Hamburg or a Prussian aristocrat donating to the many clubs and societies of the Young Conservative movement, it was that Germany is in dire need of change. Not just superficial political change where a Führer and his cronies lead, but one where the Führer leads a spiritual revolution in Germany. One where the German spirit is irrevocably changed for the better and is able to overcome the trappings of liberal modernity and Marxism.\n\nThis third position has thus led us to the launch of the [GetMechanicName] in Germany, which will witness a massive overhaul in German society. Of course, massive shifts in society are not guaranteed to succeed. Social engineering is never easy, and depends strongly on the reception of our policies by the people. While we may be entrenched in the government, §Snational morale§! is still extremely important to ensure that a wave of apathy does not handicap our efforts, yet we also must ensure that the general §Vsocial outlook§! for society remains revolutionary enough for a massive change to be feasible.\n\nFurthermore, there are the states of Germany themselves. Not every state in the Reich can claim to be of the same §rattitude§!, with all the demographic differences between the states accounting for different reactions to our policies. We also cannot expect totally even §cprogress§! in all regions of the Reich, necessitating us to take different steps towards our goal. Nevertheless, all of this complexity surely cannot hope to stop the will of the people and of the Führer - right?"

Some might even go so far as to denounce them as having betrayed the German race through their lack of spiritual and racial consciousness. With them, they brought the degeneracy of liberal modernity and created generations of suffering and tragedy.\n\nSadly, our quest to put these villains down has come to naught. Our attempts to snuff out their wasteful activities have only met resistance and obfuscation, all while they continue to profit at our expense. We cannot deny that they are needed for the war effort and for the general survival of German industry, but they will from now on remain out of our grasp - at least for now..."

With them, they brought the degeneracy of liberal modernity and created generations of suffering and tragedy.\n\nThankfully, our quest to put these villains down has succeeded greatly. Our attempts to snuff out their wasteful activities have proved far more successful than we had presumed and now they are starting to realize the true benefit of working in lockstep with the state and the people. We can very much respect their German ingenuity and courage to innovate as well as accept their necessity for the war effort and for the advancement of Germany, proving to the liberals of the world that capitalism very much can be overcome and beaten."

Outrage has erupted from the local districts, with mass rioting by unruly Stormtroopers having taken hold as a result. Reichsführer Gauch has found not just his position but even his life under threat as assassination attempts by the furious renegades attempt to strike down the traitors.\n\nThis has granted the Valkist movement the opportunity it has always desired. With the racist fantasies of the modern TST having run rampant for far too long, a plot has been concocted with the aid of the TST-Obergruppenführer Viktor Lutze. Following Gauch’s attempted assassination, a conference of all the TST leaders was quickly called with not merely the consent but the will of the Valkist movement. As Führer Dressler commanded, the TST leaders would meet in Munich - home of the TST.\n\nIt was a trap.\n\nWith all senior TST leaders convened, the Reichswehr and loyal Stormtroopers would begin their operation - rounding up the former leaders and throwing them into prison where they belong. With the Valkists now hastily prosecuting the old TST leadership, Lutze is now unassailable. Aiming to tread the fine line between the still numerous Stormtroopers and the emboldened Valkist movement, the new diarchy between the original two poles of the Valkist movement shall now herald a new future - a future where Germany comes out victorious or dies trying."

# Stormtrooper Events

gertst.0.t: "A Night to Remember"
gertst.0.d: "For a long time, many forces within and without Germany fear-mongered the possibility of a TST regime. A regime led by a murderous band of radicals in the heart of Europe was certainly a fear present in many foreign governments - but the Stormtroopers especially have struck fear into the hearts of those who they denounce. Jews, communists, sexual minorities and even mere outcasts had to fear the grip of the Stormtroopers being unleashed upon them, nevermind an entire government run by them.\n\nIt seems however that the worst has come. With the fall of the Valkist and Young Conservative camp, Germany has been turned over to the TST. Allying themselves with discontented Valkists and disillusioned Young Conservatives, the Stormtroopers have taken the reign of state, with reports of terror being unleashed by local Stormtrooper chapters upon the hapless enemies of new Germany."
gertst.0.a: "Deutschland - für dich kam der Tag!"
gertst.0_tt: "§tGermany - the day has come for you!§!"

gertst.1.t: "The Next Führer"
gertst.1.d: "The first order of business for getting the state back up and running would naturally be to decide who shall lead Germany into the new order. Whilst Führer Dressler’s role in the resurrection of Germany is appreciated, new blood is needed for Germany to be truly awakened. Naturally, many have opined that the Reichsführer-TST ought to take charge and that it is only right that they, as the guardians of true Valkism, will ensure that Germany’s destiny is secured.\n\nOn the other hand, the brutal tendencies of the Valkist movement have not been lost upon the public. Should the Führer be of their kind, it will certainly spark mass-scale fear and unrest in the public. As such, some have opined that interim-chancellor Rudolf Jung ought to take charge as the Führer. It certainly is a natural role for one of the pioneers of Valkism, not to mention that the current Stormtroopers do not seem to be entirely thrilled with the current ideology surrounding Valkism."
gertst.1.a: "The Stormtroopers have earned their place."
gertst.1.b: "Valkism is still Germany's destiny - we must hold to it!"

gertst.2.t: "The New Luther?"
gertst.2.d: "With the war against the possessive and un-German churches raging on, we are in sore need of allies in the struggle. The accusation of atheistic Bolshevism has become especially popular among religious conservatives, proving to be especially crippling to the [GetMechanicName]’s progress. Not all is doom and gloom for our cause however, for some movements have gained increasing relevance as a true German religion.\n\nAmong these is the former Gauleiter of Thuringia and now religious prophet Artur Dinter. A liberal turned völkisch reformer, Dinter’s object of a total religious revolution in German culture resulted in his stepping-back from the Valkist movement in the year of 1928. Having re-joined following the takeover of the Valkist movement, Dinter has become one of the most infamous völkisch leaders with his wildly successful völkisch writings propelling him to a senior position within the Stormtroopers.\n\nAs Dinter calls it, \"Spiritual Christianity\" seeks to invoke a spiritual reawakening of Christianity, acting as a sort of homegrown German Christianity. In it, the entirety of existence is structured along spiritual levels whereby the most impure of spirits inhabit Earth. Striving for the divine mission of self-purification to rise across spiritual levels, spirits decide which body they desire to inhabit with evil spirits inhabiting Jews and Africans while good spirits opt to inhabit the most \"pure\" of all - the Germanic people.\n\nPostulating further that race is the key to all questions in the world, Dinter has denounced the Old Testament and the writings of Paul as attempts to sully Christianity with Jewish greed and selfishness. With his writings having stated that even the impregnation of a German by a Jew or vice-versa would result in a total contamination of German blood, there is little doubt that embracing this \"Spiritual Christianity\" could herald a far more anti-semitic turn in our struggle against the church."
gertst.2.dvalkist: "$gertst.2.d$ With Dinter’s obsession on religious reformation already running afoul of our policies, some within the Valkist movement have urged us to simply suppress Dinter’s racist and esoteric movement rather than opening the door to an ugly execution of the Valkist revolution."

gertst.2.b: "The ramblings of an insane person no doubt."

gertst.3.t: "The Retirement of Axel von Freytagh-Loringhoven"
gertst.3.d: "Today, a long-coming retirement has been announced to all of Germany. The foreign minister and experienced völkisch politician Axel von Freytagh-Loringhoven. An enthusiastic member of the Stormtrooper faction within the Valkist movement, von Freytagh has opted to retire due to ailing health. Along with his retirement, many now see the opportunity for true Stormtroopers to take over the foreign office at last. In this venture, the Austrian Arthur Seyss-Inquart has proven to be a popular choice with many feeling he will ensure that Germany continues to move towards a future where the TST lead and Germany follows.\n\nOn the other hand, others feel that Seyss-Inquart is far too affiliated with the Stormtrooper movement to be an appropriate foreign minister. What is needed is a true diplomat with connections across the world to ensure Germany’s interests are represented. For this, many have championed Friedrich Grimm, a lawyer turned Valkist politician. A völkisch politician of the highest order, Grimm has diplomatic connections in France and has continuously advocated for the Volk’s interests without being seen as a puppet of the Stormtrooper movement - making him an appealing candidate to those who appreciated von Freytagh’s supposed non-partisan nature."
gertst.3.a: "Seyss-Inquart will push Germany's interests forward."
gertst.3.b: "Grimm has the connections necessary."

gertst.4.t: "Stormtrooper Chaos"
gertst.4.d: "The call for the expunging of all degenerate elements from Germany has clearly been heard loud and clear. Whilst rowdiness and thuggish behavior has always been built into the TST psyche - the call for revolution against foreign culture has caused such excesses to show themselves on display. Besides the typical target of stores owned by Jews, jazz clubs, foreign embassies among other perceived enemies of Germany have also been made targets in the recent wave of violence.\n\nIn turn, this has sparked an international condemnation not seen since the days of the first war. No doubt funded by international Jewry and their Marxist puppets, many German-owned stores have been boycotted and the foreign office has been barraged by notes of protest and threats of sanctions or even embargos. The popular outrage against the Stormtroopers has already reached fever pitch in the liberal powers, with many in the government whilst outwardly supportive of the recent chaos lamenting the damage this has wrought upon Germany’s international image."

gertst.5.d: "The German people and race have always had a long tradition of settling in the East to build a better life not just for themselves, but for the whole race. From the Teutonic Knights to the Prussians, our orientation has always ought to be towards the wild East. Populated by uncivilized Slavs and Poles, the Eastern lands once ruled by the Tsars have always proved ripe for German influence and expansion.\n\nNow with the Bolshevik threat vanquished, Germany can finally fulfill its destiny. Comprehensive plans for the systematic exploitation and colonization of the East have all been collated under the name ‘Generalplan Ost’, with it being now our duty to ensure that the East shall become the domain of Germany. Just like India was for the British, Russia shall be for us!"

gertst.6.t: "The Question of the Eastern Office"
gertst.6.d: "As we endeavour to settle the east, there has been much debate on who will and how may the government do so. One such office of debate is the foreign office, within which a small little department around the Baltic-German turned TST official Alfred Rosenberg. With a comprehensive vision of how to build Germany’s future in the East, many have been drawn to Rosenberg’s office and now with the debate raging within the government have called for Rosenberg to be made the head of the new office to be set up for the Eastern colonies.\n\nThis has not been universally acclaimed however. Many stormtroopers view Rosenberg as an upstart pseudo-intellectual whose only claim to fame is a relatively mediocre book. Additionally, little good has been made of Rosenberg’s organizational skills which may make him an undesirable candidate for organizing a grand colonial project like the one we shall undertake."
gertst.6.a: "There is no one better suited than him."
gertst.6.b: "He has nothing to offer, shut him and his little department down."

gertst.7.t: "The Fate of Ukraine"
gertst.7.d: "As we continue to plan for how Germany may tame the wild East, the issue of who shall lead the administrations to be established there has commenced. While native collaborators have already been dismissed as a choice, who within or without the TST shall take the role of Reichsstatthalter in these lands has become a hotly debated question.\n\nThe most hotly debated position no doubt however has been in the Ukraine, where Reich officials scramble to be given the opportunity to lead this lucrative land of milk and honey that will ensure Germany need not rely on liberal powers to feed itself. Rosenberg for his part has offered his close associate Alfred Meyer to lead the new territory. Although Meyer’s appointment would improve Rosenberg’s standing within the TST greatly and his vision as a result, some have cautioned against granting such an unknown element such a role."
gertst.7.a: "We can trust the men Rosenberg has to offer."
gertst.7.b: "Is this really a good idea?"

gertst.8.t: "The Visionary for the East"
gertst.8.d: "The rise of Alfred Rosenberg has not gone unnoticed within the TST. Once merely a high ranking Baltic functionary, Rosenberg has now become one of the leading ideologues in regards to Germany’s future on the world stage. Most of all, Rosenberg desires to place Germany’s focus squarely in securing her eastern gains and ensuring ultimately that Germany becomes a great empire just like London has.\n\nOf course, this single-mindedness in the East has caused many to take a great dislike to Rosenberg, with many within the Stormtroopers viewing him as a feckless man of ideas who is incapable of enacting anything great. Still, Rosenberg has now made his desire to be made foreign minister known, with many within the foreign office considering it the ultimate promotion for him."
gertst.8.a: "What an utterly absurd thing to consider."
gertst.8.b: "He has earned it."

gertst.9.t: "Reichswirtschaftsminister Feder"
gertst.9.d: "The economy has always been a weak point for the völkisch movement. Whether they be in the green uniform of the Stormtrooper or in suit and tie, many technocrats and financial officials have feared a Völkisch revival. After all, how on earth can they simultaneously rearm the nation, bring about economic growth and also return German society to a simpler, more agrarian style?\n\nAn engineer by trade, Gottfried Feder has stood out as the preeminent economic thinker within the Stormtroopers. Writing on the machinations of Jewish international capital and greedy industry to enslave the German people through interest, Feder has gained repute for his extensive vision on a proper völkisch future where the dreary industrial cities are reduced into plentiful and happy small cities with production becoming ever more efficient as a result. Additionally, Feder has adjusted his economic theories to include the slated reforms of the Reich Economic Chamber into a guild estate system with the result being the unity of national industrial interests and agrarian farmholders.\n\nHaving become the Reich Economic Minister following the takeover of the Stormtroopers, Feder has readied himself for a grand reorganization of the German economic system where every German will be included and that will serve Germany rather than the Jew."
gertst.9.a: "The Volk shall break free of Jewish capital and interest slavery!"

gertst.10.t: "Blood and Soil"
gertst.10.d: "Germany stands at a precipice, between cruel modernity and vaunted tradition. Nowhere is this more evident than in the sorry state of the German farmer. For a long time, the German farmer has found himself outcompeted with prices for his worthy labour degraded by liberal capitalism’s debased standards. With the old system seeing to the impoverishment of the German farmer, it was down to the Valkist movement to rescue the peasants.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that the old Valkist movement was infiltrated by Bolsheviks and other miserable elements, seeking to turn Germany into some kind of Soviet state. Now with the new government at the helm, the old agricultural ministry has been thoroughly cleansed, with the new agriculture minister taking the helm being none other than the esteemed Richard Walther Darré.\n\nWhilst he may not have been born natively in Germany, Darré has proven himself an energetic campaigner of the new Germany - having rallied many farmers to the banner of the National-Valkist movement. For him and us, there can be little doubt of the close spiritual bonds between the peasants and their land - the German race can only regenerate through not merely the restoration but furthering of this bond between the people and their land. Unlike the nomadic Jews and their lackeys, the German people shall return to the soil where life originates and ultimately pave the way for utopia on earth.\n\nSuch a grand vision has however not pleased everyone. Such plans of deindustrialization have not proven popular among most in the cities and many even in the countryside still seek to flee for the cities where higher wages await them - not to mention the negative effect it will no doubt have on our war industries. Still, surely this problem will not prove to be one the German people cannot overcome?" 
gertst.10.a: "The soil is where the fate of races lie."

gertst.11.t: "Stormtrooper Colonization?"
gertst.11.d: "As we set upon the grand goal of spreading the great blood of the German race across Europe, an interesting proposal has been set forth by Siegfried Kasche, a senior Stormtrooper. In the outline, the TST would collaborate with the agricultural ministry in ensuring the political and racial reliability of settlers, with Stormtroopers being granted primacy in options for settlement both within and outside of the Reich.\n\nTo also continue the quest of the German race’s expansion in influence and prestige, Stormtroopers would be among the first to supply the East with the superior men needed to ensure that Germany retains her rightful lands, away from the irresponsible and corrupt Slav as well as their Jewish masters.\n\nAlthough there have been few voices against such an act, some have cautioned granting the Stormtroopers too much power compared to the rest of the government - even if the alliance of the two is the basis of the new German nation."

gertst.12.d: "Ever since the rise of the Stormtroopers, few have been quite as energetic as chancellor Rudolf Jung in spreading the good news of Germany’s revival. One of the early thinkers of the Valkist idea, Jung found himself increasingly sidelined as Dressler and his modernist Bolshevik goons took over the fledgling Valkist movement. With the great reversal of 1936 however, Jung would see his fortunes change for the better as the old Valkist way would be supplanted by the Stormtroopers. Serving as the civilian face of the otherwise brutish TST, Jung never wavered in his commitment to the core of Valkist ideas.\n\nIndeed, it would simply be the way to achieve the ultimate goal of national socialism, a goal which would require the unification of all Germans, the total exorcism of Jewry from the German nation and ultimately the overthrow of the liberal world order that has held down the naturally superior German nation.\n\nNow however, it seems that the people’s revolution has lost its way, entering into useless fights with the Church in a totally misguided attempt to restore Wotan, not to mention the freakish obsession with turning Germany into a one big farm and the general chaos caused by the blustering about of stormtroopers - so says Jung’s newest piece. This critique of the government has not gone unnoticed, with general discontent against the Stormtrooper regime being felt not just outside of the regime, but also within the ruling movement. Whilst some have taken this as a sign that now is the time to halt our more esoteric policies, many of the new stormtroopers have not taken kindly to this with some even calling for us to expel Jung from his chancellor and trial him for treason."

The German people were thus as a whole left behind as a poisonous sort of \"revolution\" engulfed Germany.\n\nWhilst we may have saved Germany from this poison, not all people have seemed willing to detach themselves from the entire rotten system. Many Valkists, most especially chancellor Jung have clung on to the wishful thinking that Germany’s fate is one of Valkism. While this is admittedly a völkisch iteration of it, their version of Valkism is still not enough to bring about the völkisch revolution that Germany truly needs.\n\nThus things have come to a head.

gertst.14.d: "The long-awaited conference has come. With tensions having come to a boil between the young and the old in the Stormtroopers and the wider völkisch movement as a whole, the conference at Bamberg opened with opening statements given by Julius Streicher and Ludolf Haase - further indicative of the split within the völkisch movement.\n\nStepping up onto the podium, Rudolf Jung has rallied the many orthodox Valkists within the upper echelons of the TST as well as those disturbed by Gauch’s supposed extremism to urge that Reichsführer-TST Hermann Gauch step down for the good of the Reich and Valkism. Gauch’s affinity for Valkism is doubtlessly questionable and his extremism more so with his special obsession of race having disgusted many regular Germans. Ending the speech with a reminder that the völkisch movement must not only remain united but also connected to the reality on the ground, Jung would step down from the podium seemingly to thunderous applause.\n\nNow it was the Reichsführer’s turn to reply. Gauch began with a furious demeanour, questioning Jung’s belief in the entire völkisch movement if he could not accept that race was the vital power of the German people. Further denouncing Jung as a hidden traitor and follower of Dressler, Gauch left little doubt as to what Jung’s fate ought to be. Either he would resign and retire or he would be forced out.\n\nWith tensions high and furious arguments being thrown back and forth, the ultimate result of the Bamberg conference would soon be decided. For the entire völkisch movement has now realized that..."
gertst.14.a: "...the time has come for Jung to retire."
gertst.14.b: "...it can no longer be denied - Gauch must go."

gertst.15.t: "Discontentment within the TST"
gertst.15.d: "Recent events have proven contentious within the Stormtroopers. As Germany continues to undergo \"social revolution\", whispers of discontent against Führer Rudolf Jung have grown into loud denunciations of the \"bolshevik\" and \"traitorous\" nature of the Valkists under the Führer’s wings. Whether they are dissatisfied with the direction the revolution is headed or they are upset with the supposed lack of progress in it, the Stormtrooper situation has simply become too large to ignore.\n\nTo deal with this, the government could of course ensure that the TST remains loyal to the Führer and to Valkism. It was after all what Germany was always meant to be, which combined with their disloyalty can and should not simply be tolerated. On the other hand, many feel an actual crackdown would be impossible considering it is the Stormtroopers who run such affairs - limiting us to only weak gestures that could potentially showcase our weakness before we can fully bring them into line.\n\nAnother proposal however has come out, that being to instead bribe them into silence. Surely they could not complain if they were granted additional funds and power? Although more conservative elements feel that this is a capitulation to uniformed thugs, it might be the only way to steer clear of a full-on revolt by their legions."
gertst.15.d_gauch: "The Führer’s recent 'capitulation' to Jung and his more orthodox Valkists has not been taken well by the rank-and-file Stormtrooper. Once steadfast supporters of the Führer, faith has clearly wavered as the chancellor supposedly diverts the direction of the \"social revolution\", away from the real end goal of a greater, ethnically homogenous and Jew-ridden Germany and instead towards an unrealistic ideal of an ultra-militaristic Bolshevik-style system.\n\nFührer Gauch for his part has made his displeasure with Jung apparent. Having disliked conceding the chancellorship to Jung, a man who did little beyond theorizing during the \"Kampfzeit\", Gauch now fears that Jung will now go beyond and even betray the entire Stormtrooper revolution in favor of something much closer to Adam Dressler’s vision of Germany.\n\nNo matter how true these fears are, it is very tempting for Gauch to attempt to punish Jung through means of censorship and curtailment. As the Führer, it is his right to strip this wild chancellor of his powers beyond the most ceremonial and it would be befitting of the most righteous among the Stormtroopers to wield it until Germany is victorious. Pessimists point out that this would likely lead to a total split within the Stormtrooper movement, but naturally their alternative - continued capitulation - has not proven well-liked by many."
gertst.15.a: "Remind them of their obligation towards Valkism."
gertst.15.b: "Perhaps additional funding will change their minds..." #only if Jung is leader
gertst.15.c: "They have a point - how dare Jung question the Führer?" #only if Gauch is leader

gertst.16.t: "A Lutze-Putsch?"
gertst.16.d: "Wild rumours have circulated for the last few months, with the result being a rapid escalation of fear and despair amongst the Stormtroopers. A split between Rudolf Jung and Hermann Gauch has been fomenting for a long time. As such, whispers have arisen that Viktor Lutze, a high-ranking Stormtroopers has been chosen by the Valkists and most especially Jung to replace Gauch as leader of the Stormtroopers.\n\nSuch rumours have not been easily dismissed. Loyalists of Gauch have in turn called for the TST to be purged of all dissent to the Reichsführer - intensifying the growing unrest within the Stormtroopers. Whether such a plot is truly in the works, these fears can only mean further disunity for the future to come..."
gertst.16_gauch_pov: "Disturbing."
gertst.16_jung_pov: "It is time for the Stormtroopers to be set straight."

gertst.17.t: "The Stormtrooper Column"
gertst.17.d: "While any conflict between Jung and Gauch seems to have simmered down, the suspicions held on both sides remain about the other’s goals. As the Reichsführer-TST, Gauch has made it his duty to see to the expansion of influence and prestige of the Stormtroopers. Being the vanguard of the Valkist movement and Germany’s national revival, such a thing surely is good, right?\n\nThis expansion however has taken on an unprecedented height. Reports of police chiefs, mayors and local officials alike being replaced with those either more sympathetic to or entirely originated from the TST have grown exponentially. This has sparked a fear in the conservatives and orthodox Valkists in government - the Stormtroopers might very well be growing too big for their britches. Still, the final decision remains with us, for the TST..."
gertst.17.a: "...is getting too large."
gertst.17.b: "...is simply expanding as it naturally will."

gertst.18.t: "Security Consolidation"
gertst.18.d: "The expansion of the Stormtroopers in every domain has been an ongoing event for a while now, but our initial decision to let the TST expand has seemingly taken on an entirely new dimension. While the German police has undergone a process of consolidation with disparate state police being slowly structured along federal lines, the TST have taken this to an entirely new level. Most concerningly, it seems that Reichsführer-TST Hermann Gauch has demanded that the TST take on the security apparatus of the state.\n\nSuch a move has in turn caused great alarm to the conservatives. Should the Stormtroopers entirely encompass the security apparatus of state, the TST will be nearly unstoppable by all save the recently-purged armed forces. In such a scenario, the only real way to ensure governmental stability is through the neutralization of the Stormtroopers from within. While it is definitely imperative that we control the TST’s powers however, some point out that this is nothing that is not agreeable at least in principle and that we ought to let the TST be."
gertst.18.a: "Stop this at once!"
gertst.18.b: "The guardians of Valkism need room to operate."

gertst.19.t: "Tibet-Expedition"
gertst.19.d: "With our blessing, the Ahnenerbe have set off to Tibet. A team of five, led by Ernst Schäfer set off for Tibet, successfully earning the blessing of both the British and Indian authorities in their tough trek to the hermit kingdom. Stopping over in Calcutta, the trained zoologist and his team would journey through prohibitive restrictions placed upon them by suspicious authorities until they successfully gained entry into Tibet.\n\nOnce in Tibet, our adventurers would soon establish first contact between us and Lhasa, with the team’s skilled anthropologist Bruno Beger being able to treat the aristocracy with his basic medical training. In return, we were able to retrieve the measurements of many Tibetans who some in the Ahnenerbe theorize have common ancestry with the German race. Not only that, but the team has returned with gifts for the Führer which include a hunting dog and a vast religious manuscript.\n\nFurthermore, our team was able to make many interesting scientific discoveries, with Schäfer even discovering a new type of mountain goat. Many types of fossils and skeletons as well as flora and fauna too were documented by our research team, with the result being a much clearer picture of how the Himalayas might function. Once more, the German spirit has opened our eyes to the world!"
gertst.19.a: "Excellent."

gertst.20.t: "Chancellor Gauch?"
gertst.20.d: "In a truly audacious turn of events, it seems that the TST has done the unthinkable. Having accumulated power in all aspects of government, Reichsführer-TST Hermann Gauch has sent a request to Jung to dissolve the current cabinet headed by chancellor Viktor Lutze. Pointing out the relative lack of power imbued in Lutze’s cabinet, Gauch has put his name forward instead along with several other key members that are to replace certain members of the existing government.\n\nWhile this would leave key positions unaffected, it has signalled a drastic shift in power towards the Stormtroopers. Once Gauch is chancellor, he and the TST will be able to easily topple the government should they so desire. While such a risk is no doubt possible considering the lack of love Gauch and Jung have for one another, maybe we are just being too paranoid?"
gertst.20.a: "Now THIS is too much!"
gertst.20.b: "The national revolution must be preserved..."

gertst.21.t: "End of the Line"
gertst.21.d: "It seems that the recent moves by the Stormtroopers have all culminated in one disturbing outcome. Having seized the chancellorship, the security forces and engaging its tentacles on every single government institution, the TST now has all the keys to power save for one, the Führer himself.\n\nAnd so it was. Having received the order from veteran Stormtrooper Graf von Helldorff, TST bands have begun their seizure of power across Germany. Throwing out conservative-minded mayors and administrators, the prize coveted by all Stormtroopers has given himself up. Realizing the hopelessness of the situation, former-Führer [GER.GetNameLeader] resigned his office before his arrest. In his stead, the Reich Political Chamber, filled to the brim with TST leaders has declared Reichsführer-TST Hermann Gauch as the Führer of Germany.\n\nWith his seizure of power, nothing stands in the way of the Stormtroopers’ Germany. Whether they be Marxists, pacifists, liberals, Jews, freemasons or even the pseudo-Bolshevik Valkists themselves, the TST will be ready to destroy until nothing remains to threaten their vision of Germany."
gertst.21.a: "How much longer will the Stormtroopers oppress Germany?"

gertst.22.t: "Two Sides of the Stormtrooper Coin"
gertst.22.d: "Many had thought that with Jung’s overthrow, the Valkist movement would be no more. The ideas of Jung were to be swept aside, with his feckless chambers being relegated to minor status until Gauch and his gang successfully reshaped Germany to their vision at which point they were to be turned into a historical footnote. Thankfully for them, not all even within the Stormtroopers agree with Gauch.\n\nHaving only been able to succeed at the conference due to the unity of the TST, Gauch has now found himself beset by none other than the chief of staff Viktor Lutze. It seems that the fall of Jung has made Lutze the new favourite of the remaining orthodox Valkists. With Gauch’s extremism now reaching ever further, many conservatives too are also beginning to rally with the orthodox Valkists in what is no doubt an attempt to hold back the Stormtroopers from fully embracing the most radical of völkisch tendencies."
gertst.22.a: "Just what we need - more infighting..."

gertst.23.t: "Valkism Vindicated"
gertst.23.d: "In a turnaround moment for the Valkist movement, Gauch has witnessed his TST slowly but surely escape his grasp. With the rallying of the remaining conservatives and orthodox Valkists, Lutze has managed to infiltrate much of the apparatus of state. For every Stormtrooper chapter loyal to Gauch, there are two or even three more that are willing to follow their chief of staff, Viktor Lutze.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed by the Reichsführer-TST and his staff. Yet, it is clear they were unable to stop the impending doom that faced their group. When the signal went out, Stormtrooper chapters across the nation readied themselves to bring Gauch to order - with the Reichsführer-TST preemptively disappearing as a result. Although the search for him continues, Viktor Lutze has succeeded Gauch not just as Reichsführer-TST, but also as the Führer. It seems that Valkism, in its most Jungian form, has thus returned."
gertst.23.a: "It was always Germany's destiny..."

gertst.24.t: "Purification of the Stormtroopers"
gertst.24.d: "The whispers of a putsch by TST Chief of Staff Viktor Lutze have not gone unheard. For all the apparent secrecy of such a plan, the Reichsführer-TST himself is very much aware of such scheming. He too is also outraged at the sheer gall of those who would dare to cross the line of unquestioned loyalty to one’s leaders, most of all in the vaunted Stormtroopers?\n\nNow Gauch has found his chance to punish this wicked band of traitors and remind the German people of their protector. In a shocking announcement, the Reichsführer-TST has declared Lutze and those who surround him along with other Valkist hangers on to be traitors to Germany for secretly plotting a putsch to sell out the country to Moscow. While the evidence for this is rather sparse to say the least, the Stormtroopers have set upon these enemies with near reckless abandon. As the Valkist traitors find themselves on the end of a barrel, tied by a noose or behind bars, there shall not be any resistance to Gauch from within the TST any longer."
gertst.24.a: "Who dares question the Reichsführer now?"

gertst.25.t: "The Problem of Faith"
gertst.25.d: "There is no debate: mainstream Christianity is simply not German. From the Catholics to the many Protestant churches, they simply are not aligned in the German spirit nor ideology to be considered German. To rectify this at once and resurrect true German independence, we must now decide how we deal with the very question of Christ.\n\nThe undeniable fact is that Germany is made up overwhelmingly of Christians. As such, a pagan revival enforced by the state is simply laughable in many ways. However, that need not mean that we are stuck. Supported by many Stormtroopers who are closer to the Valkist movement as a whole and who feel that the question of Faith is relatively irrelevant,'Spiritual Christianity' as it is christened by its founder and senior TST leader Artur Dinter has become massively influential within the Stormtroopers as a suitably revolutionary and German version of Christianity.\n\nOn the other hand, many Stormtroopers, especially the völkisch-minded and old fighters have voiced their disaffection with the Christian faith entirely. Standing behind them is the German Faith Movement, an anti-Christian organization led by professor and TST member Jakob Wilhelm Hauer. Although it does not posit itself as an entirely völkisch organization, it is undeniably friendly towards pagan traditions and as such is favoured especially by the most well-respected within the Stormtroopers."
gertst.25.a: "Let us follow the German way to Christ!"
gertst.25.b: "Christianity is too far-gone - we need something new!"

gertst.26.t: "The German Faith Movement"
gertst.26.d: "The origins of Jakob Wilhelm Hauer are distinctly unusual for a close collaborator with the Stormtroopers. Being raised extremely piously, Hauer would become a seemingly typical liberal religious scholar with pluralistic views. Certainly such an upbringing would put Hauer naturally at odds with the nationalist, anti-liberal Valkist movement. Despite this, one aspect of Valkism would slowly grow more and more appealing to the skeptical Hauer. Opposed to the dominance of Christianity, Hauer would become more and more interested in the notions especially popularized by the Stormtroopers.\n\nHauer would soon form the German Faith Movement with the blessing of senior Stormtrooper figurehead Ernst zu Reventlow. The movement would soon begin to fill with political views from all across the spectrum with a shared goal - the continued overwhelming dominance of Christianity. To this end, Hauer would soon begin his current object: the recognition of Germanic faith as a sort of third confession along with both Protestant and Catholic denominations of Christianity.\n\nWhilst Hauer’s political activity may seem benign however, his religious goals certainly are not. A staunch racialist, Hauer believes that all of humanity share a universal religious experience - with the differences between the religions being determined by a variety of factors, the first among them being race. Contrasting both Near Eastern-Semites and Indo-Germanics in their religiosity, Hauer postulates that while the semites are fatalistic and miserable in their belief of humanity’s inherent evil and with a god that reveals himself through scripture, the Indo-Germanics meanwhile are a tolerant people who do not shirk from destiny nor fear their god; they simply desire to worship Germanic faith that lets them prosper best. Hauer has in addition regarded Germanic morality as taking precedence over supposed ethics, with struggle in some cases being necessary.\n\nWhile few expect the movement to come off the ground without significant backing, the reality is that many of the radicals within the Valkist movement have gone much further than simply leaving the church. Undoubtedly much more faithful to Germany than the cursed churches, perhaps it is time that we consider a bold new step in the cultural revolution?"
gertst.26.a: "An excellent question indeed."

gertst.27.t: "Expedition to Tibet?"
gertst.27.d: "With the creation of the Ahnenerbe, a debate that keeps coming up is to the extent of the organization’s activities. Should we simply remain in Europe? Or perhaps search for further German heritage and origin from abroad? Some of our esteemed race theorists have hypothesized a shared link between the Tibetan people of the East and our own superior Germanic stock, which they would like to investigate further.\n\nOf course, such a proposition is not without some debate. After all, a trip to Tibet might not prove very valuable in any ideological sense, and it would be costly to undertake. On the other hand, it would certainly be an interesting experience for all involved, and some scientists have made their desire to go adventuring into the Himalayas clear."
gertst.27.a: "It is our duty to undertake scientific endeavours!"
gertst.27.b: "We need the funds for other missions..."

gertst.28.t: "Haithabu"
gertst.28.d: "As we continue to reveal to the world at large the truth behind the natural supremacy of the German race and people, the Ahnenerbe has successfully uncovered an ancient centre of racial unity between the Germanic peoples.\n\nLying within the north of Schleswig-Holstein, the remains of a village known as Haithabu have at last become fully unveiled. Whilst early digs around the area have been ongoing since the end of the 19th century, the true nature of the ancient site has only now been realized with the patronage of none other than the recently expanded Ahnenerbe.\n\nWith the excavations having been led by the skillful and patriotic Herbert Jankuhn, Haithabu has been uncovered as the ancient bridge between the Germanic peoples of the West and of the North with it having been one of the greatest monuments of early Germanic times. Once again, history has shown that the German people have a much deeper lineage than the other races."
gertst.28.a: "Fascinating!"
 
gertst.29.t: "Hof Marienhöhe"
gertst.29.d: "There are many farms in Brandenburg, but none as unique as Hof Marienhöhe. Initially the property of a local baron, the area was bought in 1918 by a youth organization. After failed attempts to turn it into a profitable farm by the organization, it was granted to Erhard Bartsch, a disciple of Anthroposophy.\n\nSeeking to put Anthroposophy into practice, Bartsch would engage in biodynamic agriculture - turning Marienhöhe into the centre of biodynamic agriculture in the new Germany. With a highly holistic view of how agriculture should be engaged in, mixed with an extreme disdain of fertiliser and monoculture, it attempts to also relay cosmic forces into the earth so as to improve the ultimate quality of product.\n\nThis has been noticed by the Stormtroopers, with many taking keen interest in such an endeavor. With the movement especially receiving support from Walther Darré and other influential agricultural officials, some believe that this is merely the first step before the entire Reich returns to a more organic and cosmic-inspired farming practice."
gertst.29.a: "We ought to learn from this!"
gertst.29.b: "Let us stick to reality."

gertst.30.t: "The Hinzpeter Affair"
gertst.30.d: "With the creation of the Ahnenerbe, the Stormtroopers have taken it upon themselves to ensure that the public is not confused by the many potential truths of the world which have been up until now hidden by the devious Jew. As such, we must ensure the integrity of such ideas, awaiting new revelations as they come.\n\nOne such idea is Welteislehre - World Ice Theory. Formulated by Hans Hörbiger, it postulates that the universe as we know it was formed from the collision of a water-filled star and a much larger one - with the frozen remnants forming the geology of Earth. This would certainly form a new understanding of cosmic history and has received great support by many within the Stormtroopers - who have found the Germanic origins of Hörbiger mixed with the theory’s fundamental incompatibility with mainstream physics, which they believe is controlled by the Jews.\n\nWhilst the proponents of this theory have successfully lobbied for its accreditation as a proper science within the Ahnenerbe, there have already been internal disputes over how far one may deviate from Hörbiger’s theories. Georg Hinzpeter, President of the Society for the Sponsorship of World Ice Theory, has published criticism of certain aspects of Hörbiger’s theories, prompting immediate backlash from Hörbiger’s son in Austria as well as violating the policy of strict adherence to the original theory of Welteislehre.\n\nIn turn, some within the Ahnenerbe have called for us to replace Hinzpeter with Rudolf von Elmayer-Vestenbrugg - a much more orthodox thinker and faithful Stormtrooper. However, some fear his appointment will aggravate the already poor relationship between the Ahnenerbe and the rest of the mainstream scientific community with Elmayer-Vestenbrugg’s public writings having derived great concern from mainstream science over its apparent pseudoscientific value. Still - surely we have a duty to fulfill?"
gertst.30.a: "Hinzpeter has got to go."
gertst.30.b: "This is quite frankly ridiculous and beneath us."


# Young Conservative Events

geryc.1.t: "The Ides of [GetMonth]"
geryc.1.d: "Just like how the tyrannical Caesar was felled by the senators, we have deposed the traitorous Valkists and their criminal gangs. While the Reichswehr continues to mop up these remnants however, we must decide who shall next take the reigns as Führer of Germany. Having called on their brotherhoods to restore order in tandem with the military, Jungdo leader Artur Mahraun has already stepped up with many of the more radical groups in the country willing to fall behind the romantic and firm Grand Master.\n\nMahraun’s highly tenuous relationship however with the conservative elite have made his taking over as Führer a highly dubious proposition in the eyes of said elite, with their preference being for a council to take over the position of Führer until the situation has stabilized and the question of who shall take over can be successfully concluded.\n\nIn this deadlock, some have suggested that Edgar Jung, one of the main plotters behind the overthrow of the Valkist order and acclaimed conservative revolutionary thinker should lead the way as Führer of Germany. Although his elitist view places him with the conservative elite, Jung has also made connections with Jungdo in his bid to overthrow Dressler - with the result being his position as a compromise candidate for the role of Führer of Germany."
geryc.1.a: "We need someone like Grand Master Mahraun!"
geryc.1.b: "We need experience and connections!"
geryc.1.c: "The Conservative Revolution must be seen to fruition!"

geryc.2.t: "Utilizing the Valkist System"
geryc.2.d: "For the Conservative Revolution to succeed, some compromises will undoubtedly have to be made. For although the Valkist system was tainted with crypto-Bolsheviks and thugs of all colours, they were right to reorganize the state along corporate lines. Many Valkists have even demonstrated their willingness to change their allegiances if given the chance.\n\nWith interim-chancellor Rudolf Jung out of the picture, the question of the chancellorship has arisen among many other questions that come with the overthrow of Valkism. To allay all fears of a partisan chancellorship, Führer [GER.GetLeader] has thus surprised many by picking someone with seemingly no name in the conservative revolutionary movement - Johannes Popitz.\n\nA financial official with a rather typical history for a senior bureaucrat in the service of the Valkist movement, Popitz’s reservations for a radical Valkist turn as well as his ties with Edgar Jung in not merely opposing but overthrowing the Valkists have made his pick as chancellor uncontroversial - though some grumble at the state this places the Conservative Revolution in."
geryc.2.a: "Let us see to the correct revolution!"

geryc.3.t: "German Christianity?"
geryc.3.d: "With the start of the [GetMechanicName] in Germany, the move towards a united church out of the grasp of Rome and controlled by the Reich has been a fraught one. Despite our best attempts, we have failed to find many religious groups willing to cooperate in the formation of a united national Christian movement. As such, many officials in the Ministry of Culture have begun cultivating ties with more völkisch groups - with the culmination of this being a joint memorandum signed by noted publisher Wilhelm Stapel and other conservative revolutionaries in support of the Glaubensbewegung Deutsche Christen - the German Christian Faith Movement.\n\nAlthough the Stormtroopers now exist on the periphery of German politics, the German-Christians have long struggled to shake off the stigma as a völkisch group with links to the TST. Nevertheless, their message is certainly admirable in many aspects. Denouncing the Jewish control of many aspects of society including the Christian faith, the church has advocated for the shunning of confessional divisions and the unification of the church into a \"Volkskirche\" - People’s Church that will unite the German nation and people together.\n\nAs such, the government has now greenlit their integration into the overall state plans for the Kirchenkampf - the struggle against the Catholic and opposition Protestant church. Still, many in the conservative movement hold private skepticism for their usefulness in breaking down the influence of the church."
geryc.3.a: "Perhaps they will prove formidable?"

geryc.4.t: "The Führer?"
geryc.4.d: "Many months have passed since the inauguration of the National Council, with the result being unfavourable for the conservative revolution. Despite our attempts to the contrary, many members of the council are held in contempt by the public as an elitist cabal of industrialists and publicists who know nothing of the real struggle faced by the populace. This has granted second wind to the opposition groups from both the decrepit Valkist fronts and their völkisch counterparts, forcing us to come to a decision as to who will become the Führer.\n\nOn one hand, the ambitious Eduard Stadtler has indicated his willingness to rise to the position as the Führer. Holding connections with many influential industrialists and acting as a prolific publicist and writer, Stadtler’s experience witnessing the Bolshevik revolution has caused him to urge for the creation of a ‘national-socialist’ dictatorship with many remembering his willingness to collaborate with the Valkist movement in the furthering of such a goal.\n\nAs such, a relative minority of the conservative movement have called for organizer of the German Club and prolific conservative-revolutionary Heinrich von Gleichen to take the role as Führer himself. While this would likely alienate many who rightfully view von Gleichen as an elite aristocrat and politician, it would be a certain sign that respectable and proper leadership will finally take the reigns of the conservative revolution."
geryc.4.a: "Stadtler will do well in this position."
geryc.4.b: "We must recognize the most talented among us - Heinrich von Gleichen!"

geryc.5.t: "Against Caste and Wealth"
geryc.5.d: "What does the Young Conservative movement oppose? It is true that we stand against Bolshevism, against the tyranny of the masses and against the unmitigated disaster of liberal democracy. Furthermore, some believe that the less said about the rampant Jewish influences in society, the better for they share a common völkisch understanding of such an issue.\n\nPerhaps then that makes it paradoxical that the biggest backers of the new government are none other than the big business owners. Major industrialists such as Gustav Krupp and Fritz Thyssen as well as moguls of media and finance such as Hjalmar Schacht and Alfred Hugenberg have been the staunchest supporters of the Young Conservative movement since the inauguration of Dressler as president. Yet, the views of these massive entities often clash with the less business-friendly views of Jungdo and even the Edgar Jung circle. With Mahraun having formerly denounced the DNVP for bringing Hugenberg to pre-eminence, the relationship especially between these elites and Jungdo remain awkward to say the least. Nevertheless, these economic elites have conceded the position of economic minister to Jungdo-affiliate Gustav Hülser, though it still remains to be seen how the Young Conservative plan shall be executed."
geryc.5.a: "This seems paradoxical..."

gerexp.5.d: "The end of the Great War should have meant the ultimate curtailment of Berlin’s grandiose dreams of world hegemony. With an extensive demilitarization and many territories stripped away from Germany, many thought that the Prussian menace would never again rear its ugly head.\n\nSadly, it seems that history was not kind to Germany. Falling to the rule of Adam Dressler and his ultranationalist Valkist movement, the \"new\" Germany was very much like the old in her belligerence and aggression towards the current world order. Declaring Versailles null, Germany has now remilitarized Hamburg, directly breaking the stipulations that came with the creation of the Kiel mandate. With no response likely to come from any of the other powers, Germany has seemingly made her grand comeback."
gerexp.5.a: "A new age is coming..."

gerexp.6.t: "Cordon Sanitaire?"
gerexp.6.d: "The German danger has always been present in Central Europe, but never has it been more pressing than it is now. Germany’s desire to reclaim her ‘lost’ territories along with the fanatics that reign in Berlin have thus been a cause for alarm across Europe as nations now band together to oppose this threat.\n\nWith Paris far away and in many ways just like the Germans that they claim to oppose, the governments in Central Europe have now congregated at Vienna. Here, an alliance not only to surround and resist Germany but also to remain away from the French spectre has been proposed, with enthusiastic responses from those who can see the danger inherent in joining the Entente. However, some doubt the actual efficacy that such an alliance would bring in resisting Germany. After all, are the small nations and splinters of Central Europe actually strong enough to resist Germany, even together?"
gerexp.6.a: "Let us come together!"
gerexp.6.b: "A foolish and hopeless endeavor."

gerexp.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Submit!"
gerexp.7.d: "In a hopeless move, [FROM.GetNameDef] has defied our demand for their subjugation. Claiming that our demands are somehow unacceptable and infringe on their sovereignty, [FROM.GetNameDef] has mobilized its forces in anticipation for our attack - which they can be sure we will soon launch."
gerexp.7.a: "They will be crushed!"

gerexp.8.t: "Telegram from Berlin"
gerexp.8.d: "While Germany’s recent behavior seems to be the typical mark of a belligerent and aggressive nation, the shifting winds of the world have caused them to look to us as a potential ally in their creation of a new order in Europe and potentially the world. The potential advantages of such a partnership are no doubt plentiful as Germany has generally found herself in want of allies which will grant us a greater spot at the table, but some urge for us to stay away from trusting the Huns too much."
gerexp.8.a: "We shall build a new world together!"
gerexp.8.b: "Nothing Germany does can be trusted!"

gerexp.9.t: "[FROM.GetName] Joins"
gerexp.9.d: "The response from [FROM.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has been a positive one, with their accession to the Stahlpakt being highly welcome by our diplomats and military alike. Together, we will overthrow the degenerate liberal world order together!"
gerexp.9.a: "Huzzah!"

gerexp.10.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses!"
gerexp.10.d: "Unfortunately, the fools in [FROM.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have refused our gracious offer of friendship. Regardless of their reasoning, it is clear that they can not be trusted as far as they can be used by the Reich in the pursuit of German rebirth. Still, perhaps it would be prudent to leave them alone for the time being?"
gerexp.10.a: "Then they shall be crushed!"
gerexp.10.b: "They can be left alone - for now..."

gerexp.11.t: "Impending Anschluß"
gerexp.11.d: "The German question is one that has long bothered the Austrian state. Whether it be revolutionary radicals in 1848, pan-German radicals in 1919 or the Valkists of today, many on the political extremes desire to see a union between the Austrian and German nations. With the aggressive and expansionist nature of our neighbour to the north, it was little surprise when such wishes now seem close to fulfillment. With [GER.GetNameDef] bearing down on us to hold some sort of referendum, one which they no doubt will rig, the question now remains whether we hold on to our independence with all our might or if we are to meekly turn over the country to Berlin."
gerexp.11.a: "We have no choice..."
gerexp.11.b: "We will never surrender our freedom!"

gerexp.12.t: "Free Trade with Germany?"
gerexp.12.d: "In a rare show of reconciliation, Germany has reached out to us to propose a free trade agreement between our nations. This would ensure closer ties between our nations and could perhaps herald a proper thaw in relations with Berlin, once an aggressive and demanding power. On the other hand, some in the cabinet urge caution due to Germany’s desire for a Greater Germany not being dropped."
gerexp.12.a: "What harm can closer ties do?"
gerexp.12.b: "They should not be trusted!"

gerexp.13.t: "Free Trade with Austria"
gerexp.13.d: "In an excellent turn of events, Vienna has seen fit to agree to free trade between our brother nations. Many hope that this will simply be the first step towards integration of Austria into the Reich such that Greater Germany may at last finally be realized."
gerexp.13.a: "Germans must be united, no?"

gerexp.14.t: "Vienna's Betrayal"
gerexp.14.d: "Shockingly, the Vienna government has opted to reject our proposal for free trade between our nations. While this would typically prove as a poor cause of hostility, it has incensed many senior officials in the Reich who believe that it is purely foreign influence pushing Austria’s rejection. As such, some urge that we prepare ourselves to make Austria aware of just what a betrayal they have inflicted upon Germans at large..."
gerexp.14.a: "Curse them!"
gerexp.14.b: "...and they shall pay for it."

gerexp.15.t: "The Sudeten Problem"
gerexp.15.d: "German nationalists in the north of our nation have caught the attention of Germany. The Valkist regime now demands we surrender these regions to them. Our nation is in no place to fight the Germans. If we are to have any hope of keeping these regions we must petition France to protect our sovereignty."
gerexp.15.a: "There is only one way out of this..."
gerexp.15.b: "The free nations of Europe shall stand with us!"

gerexp.16.t: "Call From Prague"
gerexp.16.d: "The government of Czechia has asked our nation to give them protection against Germany. The Valkist government is using German nationalist sentiments in German-Czechia as an excuse to annex these regions. it's clear that this is just the first step in a plan to fully dismantle the weak Bohemian nation but we may not be able to give the land locked nation any real support in the case of war."
gerexp.16.a: "France will stand up for her friends."
gerexp.16.b: "Why die for Děčín?"

gerexp.17.t: "Western Betrayal"
gerexp.17.d: "Our delegation in France has reported that their government has no intentions to stand up for Bohemia against the German threat. We've wasted too much precious time on the French and now the German ultimatum is nearing it's deadline. It seems we will have no choice but to bring up every able bodied man to arms and fight to defend our homeland."
gerexp.17.a: "The time has come - Pravda Vítězí!"

gerexp.18.t: "Czech Defiance"
gerexp.18.d: "Yesterday we demanded that the pitiful Bohemia nation allow their German people to return to their true home. As fair as our offer was it seems that Bohemia politicians, blind to the desires of their people, have chosen to ignore it. No nation in Europe has spoken up against our claims to the territory and as such we will not need to worry about any foreign intervention as our armies march into Bohemia."
gerexp.18.a: "The time has come - Sie werden heim ins Reich gehen!"

gerexp.19.t: "The Zagreb Conference"
gerexp.19.d_tst: "The Slavs have always been the dregs of Europe. Whether they live along the Danube, Vistula or Volga, the Slavs, with the aid of the Jews, have always been a rabid danger to the righteous spread of German blood and culture. Few of them hold the correct traits that make them acceptable and their culture does not predispose them to entering German culture.\n\nThis thus makes a diplomatic conference with the land of the South Slavs a rather controversial affair. Although we and Belgrade share few ideological similarities though, the utility of Yugoslavia in the fight against liberalism and Bolshevism has not been lost on many of our diplomats, with their desires on Dalmatia being no secret either. Even if they may not be in any way racially nor spiritually superior to Germany, Yugoslavia is one of our best bets for an ally in the crusade against degeneracy that is soon to come. Still, we ought to tread lightly..."
gerexp.19.d: "With relations between us and Belgrade having greatly improved in the last few years, it was only natural that some sort of meeting between our governments would eventually take place. The utility of Yugoslavia in the fight against liberalism and Bolshevism has not been lost on many of our diplomats, with their desires on Dalmatia being no secret either.\n\nDespite this as well as our ideological kinship, there is still much to put on the table before we can seal some sort of alliance between our nations. Many in the Reich have a rather dim view of the South Slavs as a whole, not helped by the pan-German claims that we might hold on Slovenia as well as parts of Serbia. Additionally, some wonder if Belgrade might even prove to be a worthy ally. With their relative strength being much lesser than Germany, many fear that they might even yet betray us in the future. Even so, many still hope that this will be the beginning of a fruitful relationship between our two nations."
gerexp.19.a: "Let us toast to our Slavic friends!"
gerexp.19.b: "So be it..."

gerexp.20.t: "The Zagreb Conference"
gerexp.20.d_tst: "In an unexpected move, the Germans have opted to reach out to us in a bid for further cooperation in the movement against the Entente world order. While war looms ever closer, few expected the rabidly anti-Slavic and xenophobic Germans to accept working with us. Although this has produced a great amount of unease in the capital, many are still excited for what this could potentially herald. Germany after all might be the only way to see Dalmatia liberated, even if it is on the heels of a brutish and bigoted regime."
gerexp.20.d: "In a bold move, the Germans have opted to reach out to us in a bid for further cooperation in the movement against the Entente world order. With war looming ever closer, many in the cabinet are prepared to parlay with Berlin in order to hammer out a deal that will secure Yugoslavia and our people for generations to come. Even if the Germans are not entirely fair in their dealings with us, many still see this as one of the only chances that we will get to see the return of our rightful lands to the realm."
gerexp.20.a: "We shall overthrow the wicked liberal order together!"
gerexp.20.b: "Let us hope cooler heads prevail..."
GER_asks_SER_summit: "Germany will propose ways that we can deepen our mutual relationship - hopefully without imperialist intentions on their part."

gerexp.21.t: "Trade with Germany?"
gerexp.21.d: "The Germans have approached us with an offer of abolishing all tariffs and expanding current trade deals between our nations. While some suspect this as a German plot to ensure our economic dependence on them, there is also much to be gained from such a deal as it would open the road to German expertise and technology which would be a massive boon to us."
gerexp.21.a: "An excellent idea!"
gerexp.21.b: "We should be less dependent..."

gerexp.22.t: "The [ROOT.GetAdjective] Germans"
gerexp.22.d: "A sore point in our relationship with Berlin has proven to be the Germans in our lands, concentrated in Vojvodina and Slovenia. While this minority has not proven to be too much trouble so far, the pan-German nature of Berlin has resulted in claims on our territory so as to ‘protect’ our German minority. Thankfully, Berlin has now proposed a solution to this issue, that being the encouragement for Germans in our lands to move to Germany and for the few South Slavs in Germany to in turn go to Germany. While some worry this may uproot social stability, it is a small price to pay for a much closer relationship with Berlin."
gerexp.22.a: "Let us partake in a mutually beneficial agreement!"
gerexp.22.b: "This is not optimal."

gerexp.23.t: "Protection by Berlin?"
gerexp.23.d: "Germany has in a untypically magnanimous move offered us protection, with their proposal being simply a guarantee of our sovereignty. While this is uncharacteristic of the belligerent Germany, many feel that this is a simple way for us to let ourselves draw closer to Berlin without too much shaking the balance of power in Europe."
gerexp.23.a: "We can only benefit from this!"
gerexp.23.b: "We would rather not draw closer to Germany."

gerexp.24.t: "Alliance with Germany?"
gerexp.24.d: "With many proposals between our great nations being exchanged and accepted, it was to be expected that Germany would suggest a military alliance between our governments. This would bind us to Berlin for the foreseeable future, obliging us to join them in their future wars. Although some urge for continued neutrality, many feel that this is the only natural next step in our relationship."

gerexp.25.d: "In a moment of [FROM.GetAdjective] short-sightedness, they have rejected our recent proposal, albeit in a profusely polite manner. Still, this has greatly hindered our plans in the Balkans and will likely act as a road-block in the future to further cooperation."
gerexp.25.a: "Unfortunate..."

gerexp.26.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Proposal!"
gerexp.26.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has received our proposal enthusiastically, with their response being positive. Their agreement will soon be put to paper and then into action as this marks the beginning of an alliance that will see to the end of the old world order."
gerexp.26.a: "This shall herald a beautiful new friendship!"

gerexp.27.t: "A Proposal from Germany"
gerexp.27.d: "With Europe now mostly under the German thumb, Berlin has seen fit to come and propose a bold and totally aggressive move. In a top secret message from Berlin, the proposal for the invasion and occupation of the rest of the Balkan nations that have not fallen into line with Berlin. While we are unlikely to face much opposition from the outside world, some still urge that peace be considered as such a move may result in a very costly and eventually futile endeavor."
gerexp.27.a: "It is time for the rest of the region to fall in line."
gerexp.27.b: "This is overly aggressive."

gerexp.28.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Hesitance"
gerexp.28.d: "Unfortunately, Belgrade does not see the situation in the Balkans as we do. Rejecting any participation in the Balkan operation, it seems that we will have to take matters into our own hands to ensure that Germany’s southern frontier remains secure."
gerexp.28.a: "Then we shall go ahead, with or without them."

gerexp.29.t: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Demands Concessions!"
gerexp.29.d: "Our economic ties with [GER.GetNameDef] are many, but it seems that in their quest for self-sufficiency and the repudiation of the old world order, Berlin has begun to make highly aggressive moves. One such move has been their recent pressure on us for a more favourable relationship, especially in regards to our oil resources. Now this pressure has turned into a full-on demand, with the prospects being mixed. While the Germans have much expertise that we could utilize, many fear this is the first step before total subjugation."
gerexp.29.a: "There is perhaps room for negotiation?"
gerexp.29.b: "Ridiculous!"

gerexp.30.t: "Romanian Compliance"
gerexp.30.d: "In a smart move, the Romanians have accepted our proposal for a more thorough and favourable relationship where the strengths of our nations are utilized further. Although their diplomats seemed hesitant in signing such a treaty, Bucharest was thankfully able to identify the Bolshevik threat and the natural cooperation between our two nations."
gerexp.30.a: "Our fuel supply becomes ever more secure!"

gerexp.31.t: "Romania Rejects!"
gerexp.31.d: "In a certainly French-backed move, the Romanians have stubbornly refused to negotiate any kind of deal that would see our relationship grow stronger. Although this is a poor cause for war, it opens the avenue for our forces to make ready for intervention against the corrupt and imbecilic Bucharest."
gerexp.31.a: "They will regret it soon..."

gerexp.32.t: "[SER.GetAdjective]-Bulgarian Reconciliation?"
gerexp.32.d: "A message from [FROM.GetNameDef] has arrived in our capital today, urging that the hostility between Belgrade and Sofia should be ended. While many find this a rather difficult suggestion to take considering their mutual claims on the other’s territories as well as historical enmity dating back to 1913, [FROM.GetNameDef] has urged that it is done for the greater good of not only peace in Europe, but to turn towards the real enemy of the Entente-backed world order and focus our energies on freeing the people of Europe from liberal-materialist capitalism."
gerexp.32.a: "We accept [FROM.GetNameDef]'s proposal."
gerexp.32.b: "Not in this lifetime!"

gerexp.33.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace!"
gerexp.33.d: "The response from [FROM.GetNameDef] has not been a positive one, with their refusal to consider any sort of reconciliation being a major blow to any attempt to construct a new order in the Balkans. For now, it seems that we will have to make difficult choices in ensuring that the Balkans fall into our hands."
gerexp.33.a: "Intransigent fools!"

gerexp.34.t: "[SER.GetAdjective]-Bulgarian Reconciliation"
gerexp.34.d: "With both sides agreeing to reconcile, it appears that some sort of [SER.GetAdjective]-Bulgarian rapprochement has been achieved. This will be a major boon in combating the old world order and righting the cruel and unfair treaties of 1919, especially considering Sofia’s greatly improved relationship with us."
gerexp.34.a: "With this, the Balkans shall become our domain!"

gerexp.35.t: "Mission to Kyiv"
gerexp.35.d: "If there was one success of the Great War, it was the disintegration of the barbaric Tsarist empire by the force of German arms. Crippling the Russians was the loss of many valuable territories, one such territory being Ukraine. This land, known colloquially as the ‘Breadbasket of Europe’, will be utterly vital to ensuring that no German goes hungry again, making diplomatic relations with the Kyiv government crucial to our aims.\n\nThankfully, there is no lack of good will from the Ukrainians. Germany is looked upon with some regard, albeit still with some suspicion. If Germany is to achieve a great diplomatic masterstroke in the reordering of the European continent, the Dnieper will be our best bet."
gerexp.35.a: "Let us pray for success."

gerexp.36.t: "The German Mission to Kyiv"
gerexp.36.d: "To some fanfare, a mission from Germany has been received in Kyiv, following which parades and tours were held across the cities for the welcoming of Berlin’s delegates. Despite the warm welcome however, diplomatic endeavors were not quite as easy-going. There is much to suspect the Germans for, with their imperialist ambitions and war-mongering nature being no secret to anyone who can read a newspaper.\n\nOn the other hand, there are few great powers who may be willing to stand up for our independence, with Germany’s position in Europe leaving them in a more capable position than Paris or London to secure us from Moscow’s prying eyes. Additionally, the Germans have proven amiable to the cause of Ukrainian freedom in the past, leaving some with perhaps a vain hope that this time they will be just as willing to stand up for us against the Russians."

gerexp.37.t: "Warm Reception in Kyiv"
gerexp.37.d: "Our delegation from Ukraine has returned, brimming with much good news. It seems that the Ukranians have taken a great liking to us, using the opportunity to deepen cooperation between our two nations in the fight against Bolshevism and Russian aggression. With a treaty for their crucial food supplies being made, this will go down in history as a great success for the new Germany."
gerexp.37.a: "Let us toast to a fruitful partnership!"

gerexp.38.t: "Treaty with Ukraine"
gerexp.38.d: "Our delegation from Ukraine has returned, having successfully signed a treaty with the Kyiv government. While this is a success as Ukraine’s crucial resources will prove vital to our war effort, many have lamented Ukrainian evasiveness on the question of membership in the Stahlpakt and all other affiliate alliances - the consequence being their likely continued neutrality which stands in the way of the future European state."
gerexp.38.a: "More ought to be done."

gerexp.39.t: "An Icy Reception"
gerexp.39.d: "Our delegation from Ukraine has returned, the result being nothing but abject failure. The Ukranians, whether infiltrated by Bolsheviks or Paris have refused to entertain any notion of further cooperation, with our ire clearly not on their mind. While these ungrateful products of Brest-Litovsk may not expect it, our return to Ukraine will not be as kind as the previous times..."
gerexp.39.a: "This will not be forgotten..."

gerexp.40.t: "Our Claim to Alsace-Lorraine"
gerexp.40.d: "With our claims in the West being made clear for all the world to see, some in the government have suggested that we announce our claims to the lost territory of Alsace-Lorraine too. They claim that failing to do so would simply suggest weakness on our parts of a Greater German solution and the repudiation of Versailles, the achievement of which they feel requires a daring attitude.\n\nThat said, the more level-headed of those in the government as well as the Foreign Office have strongly warned against such a move as it would simply provoke Paris’s ire far more than necessary. They claim that once war breaks out, our rightful claim to Alsace-Lorraine will be achieved, but that until then we should put ourselves in the most advantageous position before another Great War, which would involve not giving the French a reason to attack now."

gerexp.41.t: "The British Problem"
gerexp.41.d: "In the old Great War, the Kaiser’s great armies should have won easily. Germany was the greatest land power on the continent, nay, the world and hence the might of Germany should have triumphed. However, our victory was dashed by none other than the hubristic and liberal British, who profited from the continuation of Europe’s division from outside.\n\nThis however now raises an important choice that we must make before we can proceed with a second Great War. Following the costly Great War, London took on an isolationist attitude and has now even gone so far as to generally split with Paris over the arrangement of the world order. While relations between the two remain generally positive, many see this as the opportunity for Germany to achieve a great diplomatic success and turn the British, if not against the French, at least away from them. On the other hand, more fervent members of the movement claim that no compromise can be had with London without force of arms - though this would permanently close the door to any kind of reconciliation."

gerexp.42.d: "Sadly, our attempts to achieve peace with London have been dashed tremendously. While this outcome was to be expected, many still find this a bitter and crushing blow to our ambitions for Germany’s rebirth. With threats and violence now seemingly the only recourse that either we or London are willing to heed, the era of British-German reconciliation is over."
gerexp.42.a: "All who stand in the way of Germany will be crushed!"

gerexp.43.t: "The Old Enemy"
gerexp.43_base: "When Germany seemed ascendant, there was one nation that stood between Germany and the world. Whilst many had thought Germany secure from the backwards Russians and puny French, the perfidious Brits across the sea always seeked to punish Germany for simply existing. Even if we were able to occasionally find common cause, something that the Kaiser undoubtedly failed us at, we simply cannot reconcile the nature of Anglo-Saxon domination that looms over the entire world.\n\n"

Unfortunately, we face them without any preparation and our navy has indicated that any prospect of military success is at best slim and at worst delusional.

Nevertheless, the navy is ready to show that it can die gallantly for Germany’s future - assuming there is one."

Luckily for us, ample preparation has enabled us to gain at least naval parity with the overextended Royal Navy.

Already, the British have begun withdrawing ships from their crumbling empire to defend their home islands, minuscule compared to what we will soon be able to muster. Today, we are going towards and against England!"

gerexp.44.d: "The Germans have reached out to us, requesting some form of trade agreement and deal with them in what appears to be their pursuit of reconciliation between our two countries. While such an endeavor is certainly respectable and more sympathetic members of the cabinet believe it to be a genuine mission for peace, some view Berlin’s gesture with great suspicion and wonder whether this will mean that Germany will resist the temptation of war."

gerexp.45.t: "Renegotiate the 1935 Treaty?"
gerexp.45.d: "The Germans have arrived in London, with their request being for a re-negotiation of the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Treaty. Their supposed ‘re-negotiation’ however has proven to essentially be an attempt to repeal the treaty entirely. While this treaty restricts Germany’s minimal naval capabilities by a rather moderate amount, some in the cabinet have urged that we continue upon the path of rapprochement with Berlin, citing that times have changed and that the new Germany could not possibly be a threat to England in any naval sense. On the other hand, this may simply be the first treaty that Germany desires to tear up - with their aggressive and militaristic government certainly not doing themselves any favour."

gerexp.46.d: "With our two nations collectively at war with the many titans of the world, Germany has seemingly reached out to us either in a move of desperation or brilliance. Proposing that we collectively work together until the war’s end, this move would tilt the diplomatic axis of Britain to Germany, though some cite imperial pride and Germany’s megalomaniacal plans for the continent as reason to shoot the idea down."

gerexp.48.d: "The British have agreed to the creation of an axis that will bind the greatest peoples in Europe together.

gerexp.50.t: "Germany's Demands"
gerexp.50.d: "Germany’s desire for her supposed ‘rightful’ territories in the East have never been any secret to the diplomats of Europe. These claims have caused much grief for the Polish government, with Germany remaining ever hostile to those who control the existing Eastern frontier. Emboldened, Berlin has now come demanding that we turn over these territories to them - though such a prospect has been regarded as little more than a humiliating capitulation."
gerexp.50.a: "We will never surrender ourselves!"
gerexp.50.b: "We have little choice..."

gerexp.51.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap]'s Rejection"
gerexp.51.d: "Unsurprisingly, the Slav-minded [FROM.GetName] has refused our righteous demand for the return of German territories to Germany. Our forces are in turn prepared to destroy all who would prevent the liberation of Germany, with the annihilation of [FROM.GetNameDef]’s oppression likely to inspire much glory and courage in the troops."
gerexp.51.a: "These brutes shall be smashed to dust!"

gerexp.52.t: "Anti-British Surge"
gerexp.52.d: "Recent protests, demonstrations and even riots against British presence have broken out, seemingly out of the blue. While anti-British sentiment has always been present, the massive uptick in such sentiment in such a short amount of time could not have possibly been due to a sudden awakening of the public. As such, it was little surprise when our security forces discovered German funding for anti-British forces in our countries which have thus hindered our government’s ability to function. Although such sentiments will eventually die down, it seems that we must weather this initial storm."
gerexp.52.a: "Damned Germans!"

gerexp.53.t: "Hostility in Arabia"
gerexp.53.d: "Recent protests, demonstrations and even riots against our presence have broken out in our Arab allies and colonies, seemingly out of the blue. While anti-British sentiment has always been present, the massive uptick in such sentiment in such a short amount of time could not have possibly been due to a sudden awakening of the public. As such, it was little surprise when our security forces discovered German funding for anti-government forces in our countries which have thus hindered our colony’s viability. Although such sentiments will eventually die down, it seems that we must weather this initial storm. "
gerexp.53.a: "The meddling Huns ought to watch themselves..."

gerexp.54.t: "Boer Pacifism"
gerexp.54.d: "The Boers have always held the sympathies of many European powers, especially Germany. With Germany taking an anti-British stance as of recent, it was thus highly concerning when Boer politicians began to take a much stronger stance for pacifism and peace with Germany. Some have even called for an understanding with Berlin, citing shared racial and cultural elements as making Boers closer to Germany than the Empire. Although the more radical elements of such a movement have been censored, it still belies the fact that many Boers do not desire to fight in another Great War."
gerexp.54.a: "A product of logic, or perhaps something more sinister?"
GER_SAF_enters_war: "§gDue to anti-war sentiments, entering war with Germany while we have this national spirit will lead additionally to the following effects:§!"

gerexp.55.t: "The Question of the Caucasus"
gerexp.55.d: "The Caucasus are yet another example of the old Tsarist empire being blessed with bountiful resources and the bumbling, squandering nature of the Slavic race. Containing most importantly a vast and extremely valuable amount of oil, the Caucasus have now become the new object of our mission in the East. Our policy towards the region has not been set however, with the Foreign Office urging that we take a more diplomatic stance towards the nations of the Caucasus to attain the strategically invaluable area without a shot fired.\n\nOn the other hand, advocates for Lebensraum and eastern expansion have vigorously advocated against negotiation with any government in the region. It is Germany’s right of conquest to do as she pleases and with the might of the German race being totally overwhelming, there is no reason for any mercy to be had upon the lesser peoples of the Caucasus."
gerexp.55.a: "We should first consider a diplomatic approach."
gerexp.55.b: "No negotiation is needed - these brutes must be pacified!"

gerexp.56.t: "Berlin's Meddling"
gerexp.56.d: "Reports have come in indicating that there has been a massive windfall in favour of the Valkists and their pan-German allies. It seems that in a renewed fervor for reunification, Berlin has intensified efforts to destabilize the Rhineland with more and more of their forces amassing along the great river. Even though there are many pressing matters both on and beyond the mighty river Rhine, we must be wary of any continued build-up of German forces."
gerexp.56.a: "Measures have to be taken against this..."

gerexp.57.t: "The Rhineland Problem"
gerexp.57.d: "To a grand crowd in Munich, Führer [GER.GetLeader] proclaimed that he would see to it that the Rhineland returns to Germany. Not content with libelous accusations against our forces, the German leader has also gone on to declare the Entente as an evil institution whose existence fundamentally constricts Germany and threatens the peoples of Europe. While such a typical rally of loons would not catch our notice, [GER.GetLeader] capped off his speech with a curious call - calling for a referendum in the existing Rhenish state.\n\nThe irony of the autocratic Germans calling for democracy in the comparatively freer Rhineland has not been lost on many, yet few in Europe seem to realize the true threat Germany poses. Neither London nor Rome can see the inherent problem with a referendum on the Rhine, believing that it is unlikely for the Rhenish to declare their willingness to return and even if so that it would serve to satiate Germany greatly. With the Rhenish government as of yet to make a firm decision, we will have to wait and see what comes of the German call..."
gerexp.57.a: "A problem? There is none!"
GER_FRA_rhineland_tt: "§gGermany will try to push for a referendum to be held - which is in our best interest to shoot down or at least sway one way or another§!"

gerexp.58.t: "Berlin Demands Referendum"
gerexp.58.d: "In an ominous turn of events, the Berlin government in recent days have been reinforcing their commitment to ‘liberating’ the Rhine, with their demand of a referendum proving to be an attractive if poisonous prospect to the public at large. While anti-Valkist sentiment is high, many people who live in the currently free Rhineland will not only furiously deny any \"Rhenish\" heritage, but insist that they are German by blood and culture.\n\nThis of course provides a dilemma for us. Accepting the prospect of a referendum would not only be received positively by the public and be welcomed by the many powers abroad, but also counter Germany’s seeming motive to give a pretext as to their brutal occupation of a free Rhineland. On the other hand, some urge that we should not risk the French wrath that would no doubt follow, or worse - the prospect of the people demanding a return to Germany."
gerexp.58.a: "We cannot deny their request."
gerexp.58.b: "There is no negotiation with them needed!"
GER_RHI_rhineland_tt: "§gWe will prepare a referendum that will decide whether the people of the Rhineland desire to rejoin Germany - which God willing will not happen so long as Berlin is ruled by the Valkist hydra.§!"

gerexp.59.t: "Koblenz Denies Referendum"
gerexp.59.d: "The Rhenish government has rejected the notion of a referendum, denying the lying Germans an excuse to simply send in the troops without foreign condemnation. Still, their apparent readiness to make such an aggressive move has signaled that the time for peace and negotiation with Berlin is over."
gerexp.59.a: "A government of great foresight - congratulate them!"
gerexp.59.b: "The Germans are likely coming - grant them our protection!"
gerexp.59.c: "A government of great foresight - but we are unable to help them..."

gerexp.60.t: "Referendum on the Rhine"
gerexp.60.d: "In a rather surprising move, it seems that the French lapdogs on the other side of the Rhine have proven themselves willing to hold a referendum on returning to the Reich proper. While we can expect the French to be fuming at this outcome, for now we should focus on ensuring that the referendum goes our way to ensure that Germany can be restored without much trouble."
gerexp.60.a: "Germans must be united!"

gerexp.61.t: "Disaster on the Rhine"
gerexp.61.d: "At the end of the Great War, we had bled white for the freedom of Europe from the Kaiser’s tyranny and of Germany’s dominance at large. To ensure this, the Rhineland was to be our domain, ensuring the security of our nation for decades to come. Unfortunately, the Germans have not taken it well - with polemics against our buffer on the Rhine being hugely popular among even moderate Germans.\n\nThe Koblenz government’s acceptance of Germany’s recent demand has now thrown everything into chaos. Many in the press speak of a German revival, much further beyond than what we can hope to muster. Nationalists on the right are furiously demanding action by the government, to stop the Rhineland from turning itself over to the Reich without so much as a single shot fired. However, more left-wing elements have urged caution in the face of such an apparently banal thing as a referendum, pointing out that aggression on our part will not be taken well by Europe and even the public at large."
gerexp.61.a: "Tell Koblenz to stop this farce now!"
gerexp.61.b: "Let us try to sway the referendum's outcome first."
gerexp.61.c: "Their choice - no matter how foolish it is..."
gerexp.61.tt: "§gWe will attempt to increase the odds of our preferred side winning in the coming referendum - that being those in favour of remaining separate§!"

gerexp.62.t: "France Objects"
gerexp.62.d: "The news of the impending referendum to be held has not exactly pleased the French. Having been a ‘guardian’ of Rhenish independence since the beginning, the French have voiced their displeasure greatly with their ambassador in Koblenz even threatening to cut diplomatic support if the referendum is held. Although this would be a major blow to our future prospects, the notion of Paris exercising any control over us would spark massive unrest in the public - putting us once again in a difficult position."
gerexp.62.a: "We are sick of Frenchmen dictating Germans!"
gerexp.62.b: "We cannot risk losing their support."

gerexp.63.t: "Rhenish Insolence"
gerexp.63.d: "In a totally blind moment of disobedience and treachery, the Koblenz government has refused to stop the coming referendum from occurring. Making their disapproval of our request abundantly clear, their refusal has now put our war-plans at risk of falling apart. While many in the government simply want to pull diplomatic support and prepare for the inevitable war to come, nationalists have urged action against the Rhenish government that will ensure our security and interests in Germany for the time being."
gerexp.63.a: "Damn them to hell!"
gerexp.63.b: "Whether they like it or not, we will protect ourselves."

gerexp.64.t: "French Tyranny Over the River Rhine"
gerexp.64.d: "In a typical French move, they have blocked the will of the people and even the treacherous Koblenz government by interfering unduly into our affairs. Claiming superficial security risks, a referendum on the status of the Rhine has been blocked and French troops have reportedly begun moving towards the border in the hope of preventing us from liberating Germans. While war is undoubtedly soon to come however, some urge caution lest we start the war before we are ready."
gerexp.64.a: "The time of liberation is at hand - Nieder mit der Brut!"
gerexp.64.b: "We will be back..."

gerexp.65.t: "The Referendum"
gerexp.65.d: "Many in Germany and abroad are on the edge of their seats, waiting impatiently as the referendum continues to seem likely to sway one way or another. Rumours of French interference have already saturated the news in Cologne, Koblenz, Aachen and many more of the Rhineland’s towns and cities as the time comes closer for the fate of the Rhineland to be determined. Shall it be for a united nation together with the rest of Germany, reunited to face the trials of the world together? Or shall it be for independence, for freedom away from Germany, or perhaps to a new Germany of their own?"
gerexp.65.a: "The people vote for independence!"
gerexp.65.b: "The people vote for reunification!"

gerexp.66.t: "Continuation of the Koblenz Government"
gerexp.66.d: "The result has come out, that the Rhenish government shall remain in being with the people having expressed their desire through the ballot box of their desire to remain separate from Germany. Although this has sparked many hostile and jubilant reactions from Paris and Berlin, many in the world heave a sigh of relief as war seems to be just a bit further away."
gerexp.66.a: "Further proof of democracy's failures."
gerexp.66.b: "Today, we salute the valiant Rhinelanders!"

gerexp.67.t: "A Day of Reunification"
gerexp.67.d_germany: "In a great day for the Reich, the Rhineland has opted to return home to the Fatherland. Already, many once-fearful Valkist soldiers have poured into the streets as our forces cross the great river and show the world that we will not stop until Germany is free and whole once again!"
gerexp.67.d: "It appears that the Germans have now begun crossing the Rhine river in droves as the local population of the former Rhenish government have begun to cheer their apparent \"liberation\" at the hands of the German government. This will prove fortuitous for the rising Germany’s hopes, but much less so for all of her neighbours."
gerexp.67.a: "Huzzah!"
gerexp.67.b: "Disaster!"
gerexp.67.c: "Our hands are tied..."

gerexp.68.t: "A Shocking Outcome"
gerexp.68.d: "Unfortunately, it seems that the people have voted to rejoin Germany. While this is an extremely unfortunate turn of events for us, the reality is that we are now stuck in two difficult positions. While the military is ready to fight, many doubt that the people of the Rhineland can truly put up resistance against the Berlin government after such a show of support. On the other hand, we can expect that our government and its hopes will never be seen under the current German regime, and that we must resist if only to keep our vision for the Rhineland and Germany alive."
gerexp.68.a: "Clearly this is a result of Valkist manipulation."
gerexp.68.b: "The day of reunification has arrived."
GER_RHI_the_end: "§rThis will end the game§!"

gerexp.69.t: "Referendum on the River Rhine?"
gerexp.69.d: "In a rather amusing turn of events, the German embassy in Paris has requested our support of a referendum along the River Rhine, indicating whether the military government established there should simply withdraw and leave the Rhenish population to do as they wish. Following some diplomatic pleasantries, it was made abundantly clear to the German ambassador that France will not let the Germans simply waltz over the Rhine and threaten our security and that such a referendum was out of the question. Defeated, it seems that the Germans will only be able to take it from our cold, dead hands."
gerexp.69.a: "An astoundingly humorous notion!"

gerexp.70.t: "Germany Claims South Tyrol"
gerexp.70.d: "The problem of South Tyrol has always caused a thorn in our side ever since the end of the Great War. Once the domain of the Habsburg empire, it was ceded to Italy as part of the worthy prize for participation in the war, remaining now under our control. However, the land has always contained majority Germans, making it difficult to integrate into the nation.\n\nThis has now caused problems with our northern neighbour, the resurgent [FROM.GetName] who have now demanded that we hold a referendum to determine whether or not South Tyrol will remain ours or is to be \"rightfully\" granted to Germany."
gerexp.70.a: "Germany continues her aggressive streak."
gerexp.70.b: "South Tyrol is not exceptional - let us see where this goes."

gerexp.71.d: "In a wise move on their part, [FROM.GetNameDef] has decided to allow for a referendum in the rightfully German South Tyrol. Already, the Germans of the area are awaiting in hope and joy our glorious return as we make ourselves heard in the region."
gerexp.71.a: "Excellent!"

gerexp.72.t: "South Tyrol Joins Germany"
gerexp.72.d: "In a perhaps unsurprising turn of events, the South Tyroleans have opted to join Germany. While there was reason to expect this due to the majorly German population of the region, some have been shaken by the turnout showing the strong pan-German sentiment in the region."
gerexp.72.a: "All Germans shall be united!"
gerexp.72.b: "Oh well..."
gerexp.72.c: "Not if we have anything to say about it!"

gerexp.73.t: "South Tyrol Remains [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
gerexp.73.d: "In a just turn of events, the South Tyroleans have seen reason and have opted to remain free from the dictatorial regime in Berlin. While the vote was extremely close, the result was in our favour and shows that mere ethnic platitudes are not enough to fool our people."
gerexp.73.a: "As it should be."

gerexp.74.t: "South Tyrol Remains [FROM.GetAdjective]"
gerexp.74.d: "In an extremely unjust turn of events, the South Tyroleans, perhaps infiltrated by the [FROM.GetAdjective] government have been fooled into voting against unification with Germany. While some simply bemoan their lack of vision and impending erasure at the hands of the anti-German [FROM.GetAdjective] government, others have urged that this injustice ought to be overturned by force."

gerexp.75.t: "Claims in the Adriatic?"
gerexp.75.d: "Over the course of the conference, the topic of the injustice dealt upon the Yugoslav state in spite of the great sacrifices of the war has come up many times. The Germans have in turn promised to help us overturn this disastrous state of affairs with not just diplomatic, but material support as well. In fact, they have indicated their willingness to grant us all of our Adriatic claims including Trieste and Istria."

gerexp.76.t: "The Anti-Bolshevik Pact"
gerexp.76.d: "With the victory of the Bolsheviks and their red allies in the Russian Civil War, the ghost of international communism and its manifestations has been one that not even the most stable of nations have been able to totally dispel. All perhaps, except for the newly risen German nation led by [FROM.GetLeader], who have now formed a new international pact targeted at the containment and ultimate extermination of international communism. While many have celebrated our invitation, a great many too remain distrustful of Berlin however and urge us to reject their potentially harmful offer."
gerexp.76.d_japan: "With the victory of the Bolsheviks and their red allies in the Russian Civil War, the ghost of international communism and its manifestations has been one that not even the most stable of nations have been able to totally dispel. Although the communist threat at home has been greatly weakened, it seems that these red teachings continue to gain traction internationally. In this, the Germans, once a tepid collaborator with Moscow have now turned around and now invite us to join their new pact against communism.\n\nThis offer has now caused much debate within the imperial cabinet as well as the foreign ministries. While Germany is a western nation and former party to the coalition of imperialists during the previous century, the new Germany is neither willing nor able to involve herself in colonial endeavors. Additionally, they will prove a vital ally in the eventual war to come with the Americans, who overtime will be too powerful for us to defeat alone. Still, should we really tether ourselves to a nation half-way across the globe?"
gerexp.76.a: "Communism is an international disease."
gerexp.76.b: "Germany should not be trusted!"

gerexp.77.d: "Unfortunately, it appears that [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused our invitation to the Anti-Bolshevik Pact under dubious pretenses of diplomatic autonomy and a desire to maintain diplomacy with states that are, unfortunately, under Bolshevik rule. It seems that our quest for the vanquishing of international Bolshevism will be done with fewer friends..."
gerexp.77.a: "Shame on them!"

gerexp.78.t: "German Entourage in Minsk"
gerexp.78.d: "Despite their loss at the end of the Great War, the German state which granted us the opportunity for freedom from the red menace has now returned in its full glory. With their reassertion of continental power, the Germans have reached out to us, desiring to ensure that we remain free of the red terror and free from Russian imperialism with an offer of trade and potential alliance down the road."

gerexp.79.a: "Let us resist Bolshevism together!"

gerexp.80.t: "Belarusian Coolness"
gerexp.80.d: "The Belarusians have insolently opted to refuse our overtures of peace and diplomacy. This, in spite of our very own forefathers having birthed them from the wretched Tsarist empire, showcases yet again typical Slavic insubordination."
gerexp.80.a: "They are but a dirt spot on Europe's maps."

gerexp.81.t: "A Valkist Civilization?"
gerexp.81.d: "Valkism is not merely something that the German people believe and admire. It is not something that only Germany can uphold and believe in. After all, the Volk are fundamentally predisposed to greatness, simply not through the weak and illegitimate workings of rabble Marxism and liberal capitalism. It is hence Germany’s duty to go forth and spread the new Valkist society and world-view, not just for her own safety but also for the sake of Europe. History, a cyclical process grants us this right with the decaying liberal empires heralding our RISE!\n\nOr so Dressler wrote before the takeover of the Valkists in 1932. Unlike the narrow-minded völkisch movements who materialistically put too much stock into blood, Dressler argues that Germany must spread the Valkist revolution in Europe to spread it to all peoples and nations, creating a new civilization out of the ashes of the old to rival the liberal West dominated by Anglo-Saxon finance and the rising Eastern nations, especially Japan and China all while holding back the scourge of international Marxism which seeks to degrade all people.\n\nSuch a doctrine has been both well-acclaimed by those typically hostile to the Valkist movement and scorned by those who might otherwise have served as the Wotansknoten’s most fervent supporters. Many traditionally far-right figures have denounced such a plan as thinly-veiled pan-European pandering that will result in the erasure of Germany with the more radical questioning Dressler’s race. Still, surely it is something to behold?"

GER_can_divy_states_up: "§CWe will gain the ability to partition specific states to aid the spread of the Valkist revolution to Europe§!"

gerexp.82.t: "The Confederation Concept"
gerexp.82.d: "The nation state has always proved to be both a blessing and a curse. While it is true that the nation is something to behold as above oneself, a true representation of the people - it also has proven able to fall into petty disputes with one another, leaving them vulnerable to liberal capitalism and Marxism. Valkism seeks to wipe away this unfortunate system eventually through a European Valkist revolution that may very well be worthy enough to spread to the entire world, but to do this we must first ensure the subjugation of all national identities.\n\nThis is not simple to do. After all, not only will we have to grant support to these unstable confederations lest they collapse, but they do not even have much basis in history nor reality. Creating an artificial state is difficult and as such we must tread lightly in regards to this problem."

[GER.GetLeader] lauds our nation's unique history and the power of leaders like Sun Yat Sen to transform it so quickly into a rising power. [GER.GetLeader] ends the letter with 'I have never regarded the Chinese as being inferior to ourselves. You belong to an ancient civilization, and I admit freely that your past history is superior to our own. You have the right to be proud of that past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese remain in pride of their past, the easier it will be for our nations to peacefully coexist'."

gerexp.84.t: "Germany Offers Advisors"
gerexp.84.d: "The powerful nation of Germany has offered to send advisors to our nation to assist our army in modernization. While their advice and efforts will almost certainly be helpful, it may spark trouble to push local Chinese officers to the sideline in favor of these foreign advisors."

gerexp.86.d: "With the rise of a new, highly revanchist government in Germany, far-right ideologies have never seemed to become less popular. After all, why follow the ways of the brutes in Berlin? At least that appeared to be until recently.\n\nIn spite of their ultranationalism, it appears that the Reich has begun meddling in our affairs via funding and spreading Valkist messaging and supporting pro-German groups. Whether they blatantly cheer for the Führer or hide behind \"pacifism\", their uptick in activity is sure to cause us more problems..."

gerexp.87.d: "Fighting rages on across our Republic, and in the past days we have begun to see a total collapse of our front lines as German forces punch through our defenses at lightning speed and with brutal efficiancy. Many have declared these to be the final days of the Third Republic, and hope is fleeting. \n\nCharles De Gaulle, recently promoted to Brigadier General for his gallant actions during the early phases of the German invasion, has approached the faltering government with a most radical plan. For the past week he has been desperately drawing up plans for a complete evacuation of our military and political assets across the Mediterranean Sea to our holdings in Algeria so that we may continue the fight there. Little needs to be said of the ambition of this plan, and simply the idea of it has caused great divide in our already weakened government. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been given the unfortunate task of deciding whether or not to accept De Gaulle's plans, and no matter which he chooses many more Frenchmen will die and support for his party will be lost. \n\nGeneral De Gaulle has repeatedly stressed that this is the only way for us to defeat the German menace which ravages our land, and with the sound of battle drawing nearer, we are evidently out of time to ponder the outcome of either decision."

Only a few disorganized French divisions remain in Europe for us to clean up. As soon as we establish a friendly regime in Paris we will begin preparations for an invasion of North Africa. The French navy is still quite strong so we must plan thoroughly to overcome this. While the Reichsmarine and Luftwaffe fully support an invasion of Algiers, many generals in the Heer believe that we should focus our military on easier targets in Europe. Our strength on land is proven, our Navy is not. For now though we have established ourselves as the greatest power in all of Europe. We must choose our direction carefully to keep this position."

gerexp.89.d: "Regretfully our forces have been defeated, with the Huns now at the gates of Rome. With no allies to rely on, we must now consider escaping, relocating the government to Libya to escape the German occupation. We will reign as a government in exile until we can claim back our land. Whilst many in our government have proposed continuing the fight until the bitter end, some have pleaded for peace to prevail, so as to at least reduce the suffering of the Italian people."

gerexp.90.d: "We've pushed the cowardly, back stabbing Italians past the Eternal City, Rome, and now they've finally surrendered to our great army. The remnants of the Italian government have fled the continent, choosing instead of surrendering like men, to run away like dogs with tails between their legs. We are now the supreme power in Southern Europe, with all nations trembling at the might of Deutschland!.\n\nHowever, this has raised a new question. Do we continue on to Libya? Whilst this may be an appealing choice to the more adventurous part of our government, many pragmatists have urged against such an endeavor as potentially costly as crossing the Mediterranean."

gerexp.94.d: "As the fires of war begin to engulf the entirety of Europe, it seems that the hour of destiny has finally arrived at Germany’s doorstep. Ready or not, the German people will stand up and reunite all Germans, destroy the decadent Entente world order and once and for all assert Germany’s dominance across Europe.\n\nHaving overcome all internal opposition, we must now face down what will prove to be the German people’s greatest challenge in our history. In accordance with their eternal quest to destroy the German people, the great powers have banded together to stop the undeniably superior German nation from fulfilling our destiny as the heart of Europe and the world at large. In spite of their feeble attempts to shirk from European affairs, the English have seen it right to impose themselves upon Europe alongside their French allies, setting the stage for another Great War.\n\nThis has caused many in the Reich to begin doubting whether Germany can really win another war, moreso in a worse position than the Kaiser was in. With Britain and France standing against Germany once again, the only thing we can be sure of is further dismantlement and humiliation if we lose. Be that as it may, no matter if the combined British and French empires dwarf us in size..."
gerexp.94.a: "Final victory will be ours!"

gerexp.95.t: "Endsieg"
gerexp.95.d: "As a new day rises over the world, it has become apparent to all. Once thought to be nothing more than a menace in the middle of Europe, Germany has overturned the entire world order and is now the definite master of Europe. From the Atlantic Coast to the Russian steppe, Germany stands victorious with no power ready to take away her rightful sphere and beat down the German people.\n\nIn turn, our regime has now become even more wildly popular than ever. Every day, people celebrate the Führer and his great accomplishments, with the [GER.GetMechanicName] chief among them. Through iron will, soldierly courage and a grim determination, Germany has triumphed over her eternal foes - there will never be a second Versailles."
gerexp.95.a: "The crimes of November have been avenged..."

gerexp.96.t: "The Berlin Conference"
gerexp.96.d: "With German hegemony on the continent assured for the foreseeable future, Führer [GER.GetLeader] has seen fit to call a grand conference of Europe where all righteous nations of Europe may come together for peace. After all, the new Germany is not one that desires to barbarically annihilate her enemies, but rather simply make Europe recognize her fundamental destiny and to unite the continent, so that no more brother wars may happen again.\n\nConvening in the German capital of Berlin, the Führer would be met with many platitudes and gracious thanks for his leadership of the new Germany, one that has successfully vanquished the Bolshevik state and restored peace to Europe. Even so, international plutocracy still remains a threat and hence the Führer has seen fit to keep the Stahlpakt in place as we Germany now prepares herself for further glory."
gerexp.96.a: "To a new era of peace in Europe!"

gerexp.97.t: "Opening of the Valkist European Congress"
gerexp.97.d: "In a grand moment of historical justice, the Valkist revolution has overcome Germany’s greatest challenge yet, with those who had mocked the Führer years earlier now silently quaking in their boots as Valkism reigns triumphantly in Europe. With Europe now mostly free of liberalism and Marxism, Führer [GER.GetLeader] has now initiated the next step in the Valkist revolution: the establishment of a Valkist civilization.\n\nIs it not Germany’s duty to enlighten the moribund peoples of Europe to the genius of the Führer and of Valkism? As such, a Valkist European Congress has been called in Munich, the birthplace of the Valkist revolution. Soon, a new Valkist age shall be inaugurated!"
gerexp.97.a: "Sieg Heil!"

gerexp.98.t: "The German Order"
gerexp.98.d: "The German people have always been among if not the greatest people to have ever lived. Despite the machinations of international finance, Bolshevism and all other tools of Jewry, the German heroes of ages past have brought about some of humanity’s greatest moments. However, the weak Kaiser and his aristocratic lackeys lacked the will to totally purge Germany of her most despicable enemies, especially the racial pests who at every turn broke down Germany’s racial strength and through their very presence diluted the greatness of Germany’s past.\n\nBut no more. Even in spite of their best attempts to destroy Germany through ineffective republicanism, the international anti-German cabal failed! They could not stop us even when they pitted the misguided Dressler against us in a profoundly unfortunate turn of events. The Volk have once more done the seemingly impossible and have defied the plans of our enemies through rightful hegemony in Europe.\n\nThis time, we will not let silly delusions of pan-Europeanism fool us. Not every European is the same, and to compare a barbaric Pole to a civilized German is simply liberal buffoonery. By the Führer’s orders, Germany shall now entrench her rightful empire by blood across Europe and see to it that the Volk gains the living space they have always needed and deserved."
gerexp.98.a: "Für Volk und Führer!"

gerexp.99.t: "The Formation of [?GER.economic_sphere.GetName]"
gerexp.99.d: "With Germany the uncontested king of Europe, they have now created a new economic sphere to replace the old liberal order. To build this new order, Germany has now reached out to us to join them in the newly formed [?GER.economic_sphere.GetName], promising that a more prosperous Europe can be built going forward. While such a prospect is certainly enticing following years of hard war, fear of German domination continues to weigh heavily on the minds of many."
gerexp.99.a: "Together for a brighter future!"
gerexp.99.b: "We should opt out."

gerexp.100.t: "Deutschland Über Alles"
gerexp.100.d: "At the end of the Great War, it seemed that global capitalism and liberalism had won out over German will. Germany was betrayed, handed over to the Entente by traitors and scum seeking only their own enrichment. The notion that this new Germany would ever rise beyond a meek republic servile towards Paris was certainly a laughable one. Germany would never rise again.\n\nOr so the plutocrats had thought. While the machinations of the treacherous liberal democratic world order continued to play out, a man embodying all of Germany’s virtues came out of the woodwork. Together, this man, Adam Dressler, collected all the faithful who had not lost faith in Germany. For no matter how decadent the republic was, Germans throughout the land awaited the day of freedom from Versailles and from the liberal West.\n\nAnd so it was. Though fraught with internal strife, we eventually came out of the republic and soon Germany turned outwards. With all the might that she could muster, Germany and the Volk stood up and smashed the crumbling Entente order into dust. Next were the powers of global usury and international Bolshevism, with their destruction ensuring Germany’s safety from these dangers to her very existence.\n\nSo now we stand alone, the preeminent superpower and at the head of a new civilization. A civilization where materialism, decadence and weakness have been defeated. Now then is the perfect opportunity to remind ourselves..."

gerexp.101.t: "The Parliamentary Problem"
gerexp.101.d: "With the beginning of the Valkist European Congress, the fundamental tenets of Valkism, not just in Germany but the world are to be laid. To this end, many Valkist movements, from the esoteric to the highly orthodox look to the German path as the way to resurrect the dying nations of old. The first tenet that is to be understood hence is the inherent evil and decadence of parliamentarism and liberalism. No matter what shade of color it takes, liberal democracy is simply ineffective.\n\nAs such, Valkist \"parties\" are to be eschewed totally. As Führer [GER.GetLeader] has made it abundantly clear, no self-proclaimed Valkists ought to partake happily in parliamentarian debacles. Rather, movements of enlightened veterans and soldiers are to take the lead and be the guiding light for all of their people to lead their nation once more to glory and towards the German way - the only correct way."
gerexp.101.a: "Down with liberalism!"

gerexp.102.t: "Rooting Out Bolshevism"
gerexp.102.d: "A common problem that the Valkist front at home as well as abroad have faced is the rather unfortunate label of National-Bolshevism. While we do not necessarily hold a dogmatic hatred against such a label, it has only provided headaches both for organizers who find difficulty in avoiding supposed \"anti-socialist\" crackdowns but also for the theorists who find their movement slowly filled with more working class rabble than ever.\n\nTo this end, the anti-Bolshevik and anti-Marxist stance of Valkism must be made clear to all. In spite of all attempts by international Marxism, by their Jewish supporters and even by the blind liberal plutocrats, Führer [GER.GetLeader] has personally overseen the elimination of the wretched communists from Germany and together, the Valkists of the world can not only resist their infiltration but once and for all vanquish this evil from the world!"
gerexp.102.a: "We shall not let Marxists infiltrate the movement!"

gerexp.103.t: "Our Civilizational Foes"
gerexp.103.d: "Even though we may have won in Europe, the Valkist civilization and way of thinking is not yet totally safe from the devious plots of our foes and the inevitable tide of history. For while history is indeed a cyclical process whereby eventually our descendants will once more be proclaiming a righteous national revolution of their own, we cannot let this be an excuse for indecisiveness in protecting the new Reich and Europe from further chaos.\n\nOne simply has to look both east and west to witness this. While the Russians have been tamed for the time being, beyond them lay the rising civilizations of the East, with both the Japanese and Chinese having come out of their recent struggles stronger than ever. In defending Europe, they pose a potential danger to European hegemony in the world. On the other side, the West, now led by the vanguard of plutocracy in Washington, continue to debase themselves in degenerate thinking and ideas even after their devastating losses in Europe.\n\nIf we are to preserve our new Europe, we must be ready to take bold action against them. As the Führer has rightly pointed out to the delegates, war is not something to be afraid of for it revitalizes the nation and people. What better way for the defeated nations of Europe to rise again than through some good old fashioned combat?"

gerexp.104.t: "The Pan-Valkist Movement"
gerexp.104.d: "Following hours of civilized, respectful discussion, the delegates have unanimously agreed to all of the Führer’s points. For if there is only one truly great Valkist nation out there, it would be the revived German Reich. Perhaps most importantly of all, the delegates have seen the light that Germany and Valkism now proudly showcases to the whole world. If war in Europe is to truly end, all must work towards the Führer and towards Valkism in the German image.\n\nThe first step to this hence is the abolition of all petty national interests. Valkism shall be the herald of a new Reich in a new Europe. One where mere borders do not matter for the Führer, the greatest living being on Earth and the leader all Valkists aspire to be shall unite all under one European banner. For the European way of life and for Valkism…"

gerexp.105.d: "It seems that in a perhaps uncharacteristic act of friendship, the Germans have sent over military advisors to our country to help us build our military up to be on a similar standard as to the very much vaunted German military. With a long history and much expertise, our military development is sure to benefit."

gerexp.106.d: "It seems that in a perhaps uncharacteristic act of friendship, the Germans have sent over technical advisors to our country to help us build our industrial and technical base up to be on similar footing as the large and well-oiled German economy. With Germany being one of the premier engineering powers and holding much expertise that we might be able to utilize, our economic development is sure to benefit."

gerexp.107.t: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Requests Resource Rights"
gerexp.107.d: "While we have been able to gain much from recent German development in our country, it seems that the Germans have now turned around to demand a concession from us. Having helped to develop the resource-rich territories in our nation, the Germans have now demanded that they profit from their investment through divestment of resource rights unto them. While it would be rather ungracious to prevent the Germans from profiting from their investments, this demand puts our ability to avoid dependence on Germany into great question."

Although they have done so without much enthusiasm, it is still better to gain massively from such a scenario rather than to let sentiment get in the way of our goals."

gerexp.109.d: "In what should have been expected, [FROM.GetNameDef] has ungratefully refused to grant us the resource rights to the lands that we have developed in. Although this is a difficult matter to levy war over, it still raises their reliability as German allies into great question."
gerexp.109.a: "An unfortunate turn of events."

gerexp.110.t: "The Polish Question"
gerexp.110.d: "The Polish state has always acted as an unfortunate black-spot in Europe, with its irresponsible nationalist governments constantly demanding more and more unreasonable territories while also taking highly hypocritical stances in regards to their German minority. With their recent defeat at our hands however, we can now decide how to best handle this unruly state.\n\nFor many, any great mercy towards the Poles is a bridge too far. What upright German with any semblance of national pride does not hate the Poles for all the grief they and their French backers have wrought upon Germany over the course of the past two decades? At the very least, a border strip of lands that were rightfully Prussian is to be carved out to ensure the security of the eastern frontier. There are however a scant few moderates who urge that we simply reclaim the rightful lands of the Kaiserreich and leave a cooperative Polish state that will be easier to manage at our whims."
gerexp.110.a: "We must ensure Poland remains submissive."
gerexp.110.b: "The Poles may have nominal independence - but we must secure our frontier."
gerexp.110.c: "A cooperative Polish state is the best way forward."

gerexp.111.t: "Escape to Canada"
gerexp.111.d: "Germany has invaded and conquered our island, far sooner than we could have ever suspected due to the size of their navy. Many members of the parliament along with the King have fled across the sea to Canada, from where we will lead the Empire in exile, fighting abroad until we take our nation back. We will not stop, we will not surrender until we take Britain and Europe back from the Valkists."

gerexp.112.d: "The British Isles are now under German control. To avoid complete defeat much of the government has chosen to run and hide like cowards in there overseas possession of Canada. In a speech to crowds of Ottawa, [ENG.GetLeader] has stated that 'this is just the beginning of our fight against Germany', going on to claim 'The brave men and women of the British Empire will not rest until they once again walk on the beaches of Dover, stroll the green fields of Wales and swim in the great lotus of Scotland'. Despite the uplifting tone of his voice it is clear to most that the British situation is lost. Germany is now the undisputed superpower of Europe.\n\nWith the collapse of Britain on the continent, some have urged that we find ways to make peace with the rest of the Empire, though this will likely not be possible if we are at war with a greater power."

During the Scramble for Africa the British empire forced our nation to abandon it's goal to unite our colonies of Angola and Mozambique by land. Instead the British occupied the territory.

gerexp.132.t: "Peace with the [FROM.GetAdjective]?"
gerexp.132.d: "As our war against [FROM.GetNameDef] continues, their prospects have grown worse and worse, especially in their war against Germany. With Germany however unable to mount a successful invasion of [FROM.GetNameDef], they have made peace which now grants us the ability to also make peace with the [FROM.GetAdjective]-led alliance on similarly favorable grounds as well. Hawks however see this as a prime moment to seize our destiny and achieve a victory more total than Germany could ever hope."
gerexp.132.a: "We will cooperate with Berlin on this matter."
gerexp.132.b: "Only if we are granted our rightful sphere!"
gerexp.132.c: "Germany has blinked!"
gerexp.132.tt: "§rIf they refuse, we will remain at war with them!§!"
gerexp.132.tt_2: "§rIf we reject Germany's prerogative, we will continue the war without German participation.§!"

gerexp.133.t: "The Japanese Demand Asia!"
gerexp.133.d: "While we may have concluded a peace with the Germans, the Japanese meanwhile remain our enemy in the Pacific. With our general retreat from Europe, it seems that Tokyo now sees it their right to demand that we do the same, but for Asia. Some have denounced this as pure opportunism and for the Japanese demand to be rejected. On the other hand, a continued war in the Pacific may not be in our interests."
gerexp.133.a: "We have no choice..."
gerexp.133.b: "They can pry it from our cold, dead hands!"

gerexp.134.t: "Cooperation with Vladivostok?"
gerexp.134.d: "With the beginning of our grand quest to vanquish Bolshevism, we find ourselves with some odd allies. Perhaps the oddest being the White Russian government that still rules in Vladivostok, now fighting the reds in the barren wastelands of the Far East and Siberia. While much anti-Slavic sentiment is present on our side, the fundamental reality is that we must also plan for a proper end to this war once the Bolsheviks have been defeated.\n\nWhile their strength is in many ways laughable, the red-Russians still inhabit a vast land that could very well devour the Heer in its endless wastes. Not even the most brutal of anti-partisan policies can possibly totally tame this wild land without massive casualties, and it is rather unlikely that much can be extracted from the Russian wastes anyways. Hence, a proposal has reached the Führer’s desk urging that we reach out to [RUS.GetNameDef] and offer them a deal to continue the war until the elimination of Bolshevism at which point the core Russian lands will be returned to them. To compensate for this, the Russian state will sign several treaties that ensure Germany’s prosperity and that the Russians never again dare to threaten Germany’s eastern frontier."
gerexp.134.a: "They may well prove invaluable..."
gerexp.134.b: "A futile endeavour."

gerexp.135.t: "An Offer From Berlin"
gerexp.135.d: "As we fight to vanquish the red menace from holy Russia, we have had little time to pay attention to the news in Europe. A message from Berlin however has caught the eye of even the most dedicated officers who have found a seemingly unbelievable message - the Germans are offering to explicitly aid us in the great struggle against the Bolsheviks, promising to grant the core Russian lands back to us.\n\nThis naturally does not come freely, with the Germans also expecting us to subject ourselves to a series of humiliating treaties that will likely result in the diminishment of Russia as a great power to threaten Germany, at least for now. Still, the prospect of a united anti-Bolshevik front can only make the eyes water, right?"
gerexp.135.a: "Together against Bolshevism!"
gerexp.135.b: "The Germans are still a bitter foe!"

gerexp.136.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts!"
gerexp.136.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer in fighting the red menace together, ensuring that the post-war situation will not be terribly difficult. This however has resulted in some grumbling among more radical circles who believe that any deal with the White government is pointless, though they have been assured that we very much are in control of the situation."
gerexp.136.a: "Excellent..."
gerexp.136.tt: "§rWe will be able to renege on our end of the deal - though it will be costly in diplomatic terms...§!"

gerexp.137.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects!"
gerexp.137.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has shockingly refused our highly generous offer to fight Bolshevism together. This has vindicated many radicals who believe that the Slav is not to be trusted, and perhaps then they are right..."
gerexp.137.a: "Typical Slavic foolishness."

gerexp.138.t: "Our Obligation to [RUS.GetNameDef]"
gerexp.138.d: "With the defeat of the Bolshevik government, the time has come for us to oblige by our deal with Vladivostok and to return the land that they rightfully claim as their own. The German troops may then be able to return home and the spectre of a costly occupation will have been dispelled.\n\nAt least that should be how it is. But some in the government question the true value of the White Russians during our war against Bolshevism and urge that we should simply renege on our deal. What harm could they possibly do to us anyways?"
gerexp.138.a: "We are honorable people."
gerexp.138.b: "They were totally useless!"

gerexp.139.t: "Germany Betrays Us!"
gerexp.139.d: "Unfortunately, the Germans have reneged on our deal and instead have opted to keep occupying the rightful territories of the Motherland. It seems that if we are going to liberate the rest of Russia, we will have to do it by force..."
gerexp.139.a: "Bah!"

gerexp.140.t: "The Treaty of Moscow"
gerexp.140.d: "In a rather sombre mood, our delegation departed for Moscow as we and the Germans set about to hammer out the treaty that would signal the end of the Bolshevik menace once and for all. Unfortunately, this treaty also now weighs upon us many concessions on our part to the Germans, who now wield significant economic influence on our country."
gerexp.140.a: "At least Russia is saved from Bolshevism..."

gerexp.141.t: "Intervention into Central Europe?"
gerexp.141.d: "The war in Central Europe has been a hot topic in the presses, both here and abroad. Despite initial predictions of a crushing German victory however, it seems that the German state is floundering in its bid to \"liberate\" its claims. As such, our diplomats have had ample opportunity to prepare a demand for Germany: to make peace now lest the war spread to all of Europe or to face our full might."
gerexp.141.a: "Onwards!"
gerexp.141.b: "Maybe not?"

gerexp.142.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Intervenes!"
gerexp.142.t_alt: "The West Intervenes!"
gerexp.142.d: "Unfortunately, our attempts to crush our enemies on the field have seemingly come to nothing for in spite of our attempts, [VAL.GetNameDef] and its allies have held us off for long enough for their Western puppet-masters to come to the rescue. Considering the prospect of Western intervention to be undesirable, it seems that we have little choice..."
gerexp.142.a: "We have failed..."
gerexp.142.b: "Never!"

gerexp.143.t: "Armistice in Central Europe"
gerexp.143.d: "In a surprisingly decisive move, the Western powers have swooped into our war with Berlin to protect us from their greedy desires. Demanding an end to all hostilities, the Berlin government has gone to war and now seemingly has nothing to show for it while we have held our own to great astonishment and admiration abroad. Still, we can expect the Valkists to be back, and when that time comes, we will be ready to slay the dragon once and for all..."
gerexp.143.a: "This is not the end!"

gerexp.144.t: "Reunification with the Reich?"
gerexp.144.d: "Despite our initial hostility to the awful Reich government in Berlin, new blood in the Chancellery has caused many within not just among the people, but even the government to consider reunification an excellent proposition. As such, should we reach out to the likeminded German government for a great rejoinment of our people?"
gerexp.144.a: "Heim ins Reich!"
gerexp.144.b: "They are untrustworthy!"

gerexp.145.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Returns Home!"
gerexp.145.d: "In a truly stunning moment of German loyalty and faith, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] have opted to return home to the Reich, reunifying our nation with the lands held under them. While foreign nations may protest this, this is simply yet another step to a resurrection of Germany's glory!"
gerexp.145.a: "The German people grow stronger!"

gerexp.146.t: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Demands Territory Back!"
gerexp.146.d: "Although the irresponsible Kiel government has been crushed, the increasingly-aggressive Germans have now seized the opportunity to demand back the territory of the old Kiel government. As a much mightier power, few can even stomach the idea of poor relations with Berlin and some urge for us to capitulate now before it is too late."
gerexp.146.a: "An easy choice."
gerexp.146.b: "Nuts!"

gerexp.147.t: "The Reich Strikes Back"
gerexp.147.d: "With the Germans having struck the freedom-loving peoples in [GER_attacked_this_one.GetNameDef], it is but a matter of time before they turn their attention towards us. As a tyrannical and ultranationalist government, Berlin stands as the premier threat in Europe and must be stopped at any costs. Many in the cabinet have now urged that we attempt to stop the Germans now, rather than allow them to slowly grow stronger as they subsume more and more innocent peoples into their vicious empire. As such, shall we join [GER_attacked_this_one.GetNameDef] in their valiant struggle against the Germans?"
gerexp.147.a: "We fight together or die together!"
gerexp.147.b: "We cannot hope to defend them..."
gerexp.147.tt: "§rThis will lead to war with Germany§!"

gerexp.148.t: "A French Border Strip?"
gerexp.148.d: "With our great victory over the perfidious French, we now have reclaimed Alsace-Lorraine and repudiated the wicked dictates of 1919. Now that we are in such a dominant position however, we now have the liberty to redraw the order of Europe at our whim. Perhaps of most interest to our diplomats and generals has been the strip of land which encompasses Nancy.\n\nSuch territorial expansion was coveted by the Kasierreich before us, and for the same reasons is of great interest. Not only would it add little strain to our security, it would deny the French crucial iron reserves and cement our righteous dominance over the whole continent. However, the more diplomatic and genteel members of the Foreign Office believe that we cannot simply push France too much while she is down and that we are better off leaving them mostly be."
gerexp.148.a: "Germany must claim what is rightfully hers - by conquest!"
gerexp.148.b: "Let us not alienate our French client too much."

gerexp.149.t: "Demands From Berlin "
gerexp.149.d: "Having bound ourselves to an alliance with Germany, we obviously expected some degree of submission and deference to them in the coming new axis of the world order. However, a recent communiqué from Wilhelmstraße 76 has shaken our country to the core. In it, the Germans have demanded that we give territories currently part of our country to them for the purpose of \"national integrity\". This has been paired with a rather unsubtle threat to punish us severely if we fail to comply - throwing the alliance into chaos."
gerexp.149.a: "Fine..."
gerexp.149.b: "Never!"

# Military events

germil.1.t: "Interservice Outrage"
germil.1.d: "The news that an academy made for not just the individual services, but rather the entire military has not been received well by the individual branches. Certain army officers have privately scoffed at the idea of any true equal cooperation and coordination whilst officers in the two other branches have expressed doubts as to whether such an affair can be prevented from becoming another means for the Heer to dominate the other branches."
germil.1.a: "So insolent!"

germil.2.t: "The Evolution of the Institute"
germil.2.d: "The Institute for Strategic Studies has come far since its opening, with many of our new mid-level commanders having undergone training there. Although we previously faced opposition from conservative elements in regards to its creation, the academy has proven itself capable in educating the next generation of officers."
germil.2.a: "Excellent."

germil.3.t: "The Academy Closes"
germil.3.d: "With recent developments in the political scene, the Institute for Strategic Studies has found itself with fewer and fewer students. With conservative elements in the Heer, Reichsmarine and Luftwaffe refusing to send their best and brightest to the academy, it has languished with few trainees and as a result has become moribund. With its closure, it seems that Germany's armed forces will train and think separately for years to come..."
germil.3.a: "Oh well..."

germil.4.t: "The Reactionary Cleanse"
germil.4.d: "For a long time, the reactionaries of the Heer have impeded us. Whether by shooting the martyrs of new Germany dead on the streets during the era of the republic, or during the reconstructive revolution where they attempted to carve out their own little fiefdom to rule - they have always stood against us.\n\nThis shall now change. With the appropriate political capital having been gained, we can now afford to move beyond these fossils of the Kaiserreich. In cooperation with the loyal officers of the Heer, we have moved to retire and dismiss the old generals. From now on, the Valkist revolution will not be threatened by the Heer."
germil.4.a: "We can do without them."

germil.5.t: "Harbinger of the New Army"
germil.5.d: "With the overthrow of the Valkists, one may have predicted that the Heer would happily stand aside as these merry band of revolutionaries find themselves expelled from power and crushed like the tiniest fleas.\n\nThis however has not been the case.\n\nWith long-standing enmity between the Stormtroopers and the Heer about to come to a boil, it appears that the Prussians have lost their nerves first. The Heer has now experience a massive wave of resignations and retirements - with many senior officers opting to retire rather than serve the new regime they deem as thuggish and cruel.\n\nIn their haste to leave us behind however, the old Prussians have only served to reinvigorate the tired army. By order of the Führer, the entire military has been cleaned from top to bottom. No more shall the German people be pressed into the army as mere conscripts - every man shall serve with pride and courage in the new German People’s Army!"
germil.5.a: "Let us resurrect a new Germany!"

germil.6.t: "The Price of Loyalty"
germil.6.d: "As we set out to ensure the loyalty of the Heer to the Valkist cause and to Germany, we must keep in mind that the Heer is not a totally homogenous organization. Certain issues may appeal only to certain people and we will only get one chance to change their minds without external circumstances. In any case, whether money, fear or a realignment is in the cards..."
germil.6.a: "...they ought to know what's best for them!"

germil.7.t: "Conservative Protests"
germil.7.d: "The news of von Reichenau’s appointment has not been received well by much of the Heer. Infamous for being a radical by Valkist standards, Reichenau’s appointment as the head of the army has induced fear among the more conservative generals of a supposed politicization of the Heer that they so desperately desire to avoid. They have thus come to demand that he resign, lest they resign instead.\n\nEven if Reichenau has demonstrated himself to be the perfect officer for the new Germany, the loss of these experienced military men will undoubtedly hit our military capabilities hard. On the other hand, it may very well enable us to once and for all bring the new Germany into the resistant officer corps, an officer corps whose alignment is paramount to the survival of the new Germany."
germil.7.a: "Fine, their wish is granted."
germil.7.b: "The Führer's wishes are inviolable!"

germil.8.t: "The Promotion of [ROOT.GetName]"
germil.8.d: "[ROOT.GER_PromotionDesc]"

GER_promotion_balck: "Not long after his promotion to lieutenant colonel, Hermann Balck would find himself in the upper echelons of command. Here, Balck served with distinction - proving himself a worthy commander and soon earning himself an Iron Cross.\n\nSoon, Balck would be promoted to colonel, proving himself worthy of rapid promotion from colonel to general. Able in both offensive and defensive action, many watch this military scion with great interest."
GER_promotion_manteuffel: "Ever since the panzers have become a crucial part of our war effort, many talented commanders have begun to show themselves. Among them is one Hasso von Manteuffel, an officer of the cavalry since he joined in 1916. With Germany rising up to break her chains after 1932, Manteuffel would serve as one of the few officers with training in armoured warfare.\n\nHaving attained several division commands over the course of the recent war, Manteuffel would prove to be an adept and agile commander - a trait that no doubt contributed to his promotion. Although some in the political realm worry about his apparent liberal demeanour, it has not seemed to affect his skill at war-making."
GER_promotion_schoerner: "In the pursuit of Germany’s resurrection, many have expressed discontent with the old generals. Far too unwilling to expend the necessary lives and resources into Germany’s ultimate triumph, the army has always needed someone strong enough to execute Germany’s comeback.If this is so, Ferdinand Schörner would be the strongest commander in the whole army.\n\nA former infantry teacher, Schörner has not only effectively been able to beat back the enemy in his sectors, but he has shown the grim determination needed for Germany’s ultimate victory. Even if many under his command privately hate him, many expect Schörner to make the Führer proud."
GER_promotion_weidling: "Out of the storm of war, some commanders rise in spite of seemingly unassuming origins. One such commander is the newly minted Helmuth Weidling, an officer with a varied service history. With the raging war, Weidling would go from serving on training grounds to serving in the field as an artillery officer.\n\nRemarked as an energetic and skilled commander under even significant pressure, Weidling would find himself promoted quickly even without being an utterly faithful servant of the regime. Be that as it may, few predict Germany will ever enter such a state that victory is hopeless - right?"
GER_promotion_wenck: "Whilst Germany’s officers are often a cut above the rest, many of them are admittedly rather aged. The grip old officers have on the Heer though not overwhelming has still proven substantial - hindering the Valkist revolution. Luckily for us, some young talents have come to surface - among them Walther Wenck.\n\nInitially serving as a teacher, Wenck would request to be sent to the frontline. Here, he has served with great distinction, serving as a very capable general staff officer with the determination and skill required of one. Besides this, Wenck has rubbed off well on the Führer, serving as a man that all German men ought to aspire to become."
GER_promotion_lindemann: "As Germany marches forward, more and more officers have stepped up to take the lead in restoring Germany’s glory. These officers most of all have faith in our reconstructive revolution, the conversion of German society into a weapon that will cause the whole world to tremble. Georg Lindemann has proven especially to be such an officer.\n\nWith the experience of crushing reds in his youth, Lindemann has served with distinction in the army from then on. With the raging war, Lindemann would soon prove himself a capable commander. Though whispers suggest that his promotion was politically motivated, such slander against him has been curtailed."
GER_promotion_speidel: "The general staff has always held a unique position vis-a-vis the government and the Heer. Filled with the best technical minds the Heer can find, the general staff has also served as a place where decisions - political and military - were made. Even in our midst, potential traitors are rumoured to lurk in the general staff.\n\nOne such rumoured traitor is none other than Hans Speidel. Serving with some distinction in the general staff as the chief of different departments, Speidel would soon find himself promoted to a rank that would make him suitable for field command. Even if his political reliability and command experience leaves much to be desired, there is hope that he will rise beyond this."
GER_promotion_lombard: "As Germany marches towards a brave new future, many courageous Germans have come forth to smite her woes. Leading this charge are the Stormtroopers, men of the first hour. Among them is Gustav Lombard, a former American.\n\nLombard has taken to the new role of the TST as a vanguard force very well. Serving as a cavalry officer, Lombard has served with valour and his ruthlessness and determination is something that we may all learn from."
GER_promotion_strachwitz: "The Stormtroopers have never been merely a fervent band of rabble. The dedication required of a stormtrooper is one that cannot be underestimated and as such it has gained a tendency to attract strange characters to say the least. One such character is the appropriately named Hyazinth Graf Strachwitz.\n\nWhilst a devoutly religious baron may appear to not be the most suitable as a TST commander, Strachwitz has proven to be utterly brilliant in battle. Here, he has served with distinction and valour, resulting in his promotion to a full-on field command."
GER_promotion_vahl: "The TST has always lacked technical expertise in the military realm, most especially in comparison to the professional Reichswehr. As we are still attempting to rectify this state of affairs, the TST gains more and more professionals in the spaces that were previously exclusively the Reichswehr’s domain.\n\nOne such professional is Herbert Ernst-Vahl, transferred to the TST from the old Heer. With a history of proficiency in armour units and excellent performance on the field, Vahl has undoubtedly earned his rank as a proud general of Germany."
GER_promotion_gille: "What sort of man joined the Stormtroopers? Many today would assume that only idiots would join the TST of yesterday - a TST that was dwindling in popularity and skill. Herbert Otto Gille however has shown that not everyone who joined was without choice.\n\nInitially running afoul of the TST, Gille would redeem himself by proving to be a skilled and remarkably brave commander. Often leading from the front, the Führer has now seen fit to grant Gille the promotion he so deserves - even in spite of his less than fervent attitude towards the national revolution. "
GER_promotion_eicke: "Theodor Eicke is a man whose name causes chills to run down the spines of traitors and enemies alike. Although the TST is undoubtedly a crucial part of the modern German army, its greater purpose is to police and secure Germany from traitors.\n\nIn this role, Eicke has served without reserve. Infamous for his extreme levels of brutality and sadism even by TST standards, Eicke’s \"totenkopfverbände\" have struck terror into the hearts of many Germans and now the enemy. Leading from the front, Eicke shall ensure the Stormtrooper is the scourge of those who hate Germany."
GER_promotion_kruger: "With the ongoing war, the TST has faced its first real trial by combat. In this war, success and failure has been achieved, but what has never wavered was the average Stormtrooper’s determination in victory. Nowhere is this less certain than in Walter Krüger.\n\nThe older brother of the dour Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger, Walter has proven to be one of the most skilled officers of the TST. Well-liked by his men and adept at both tactical and organizational matters, few if any rumours of nepotism have been flung at the general - displaying his deserved respect."
GER_promotion_preiss: "If there is one group the TST can deservedly claim lineage from, it is the Freikorps. These brave fighters in Germany’s darkest hour pushed back the red tide and prevented the victory of the reds in the Reich - this Hermann Prieß most certainly would know.\n\nFirst seeing action in the Baltic, Prieß continued to serve in the weakened Reichswehr until 1931 when officially he retired. However, witnessing the opportunity for Germany to achieve her long awaited freedom pushed Prieß into reversing his retirement from military matters, culminating in his service which, filled with success, has propelled him to field command where he shall serve with honour."
GER_promotion_kleinheisterkamp: "Infighting in an organization as radical and violent as the TST was always to be expected, but efforts have always been made to suppress this. Unfortunately, sometimes certain officers find themselves in compromising positions.\n\nMatthias Kleinheisterkamp has many enemies in the TST. Gaining infamy for his apparent alcoholism and infidelity, there is little doubt that he is also a supremely competent commander. Serving with distinction in the current war, not even his enemies could deny him a promotion. Thus although few can say that this was not deserved, we can only hope that it will not inspire backlash from his rivals..."
GER_promotion_bittrich: "The leaders of the TST do not merely hail from different social backgrounds, but even military backgrounds as well. From a mostly infantry force, the TST now has many officers with all ranges of experience. One example is Wilhelm Bittrich, the freshest senior officer of the Reich.\n\nInitially serving in the Reichswehr as a flight instructor, Bittrich would transfer to the TST to serve in the fledgling TST flying units. Bittrich would then however begin to prove himself as a competent officer not just in the skies, but on the ground where he has now earned his new promotion. With some level of proficiency in mechanised warfare as well, many look forward to seeing Bittrich in action."
GER_promotion_kumm: "Rising to the rank of general is no easy feat. Commanding hundreds of thousands of men is already an achievement one can be supremely proud of, most especially at the young age at which Otto Kumm is at.\n\nA mere child at the end of the Great War, Kumm would become disillusioned by the failures of the Weimar regime, soon becoming a passionate member of the Valkist movement. Soon he would rise from being a mere soldier to an officer in the TST forces, serving with distinct valour and courage. Although his age has been of concern to some, many have still shown themselves capable of understanding that his undying loyalty is an aid more than a hinderance."

GER_response_balck: "Promising."

GER_response_schoerner: "Der Ferdl kommt!"
GER_response_weidling: "A good choice."

GER_response_lombard: "Even Americans can come home!"
GER_response_strachwitz: "Good luck to this Panzer graf!"
GER_response_vahl: "The TST grows stronger!"
GER_response_gille: "The best lead from the front!"
GER_response_eicke: "Our enemies shall learn to fear us!"
GER_response_kruger: "Interesting."
GER_response_preiss: "Wise words indeed."
GER_response_kleinheisterkamp: "Wasn't he last reported a drunkard?"
GER_response_bittrich: "The enemy will be smashed into dust!"
GER_response_kumm: "A loyal follower of [GER.GetLeader]!"

germil.9.t: "[ROOT.GetName]'s Baptism of Fire"
germil.9.d: "As Germany continues her struggle for her rightful living space and freedom, more good news has arrived from the front. [ROOT.GetName], a capable and brave officer of the Stormtroopers has undergone training at the front. Whilst education at sterile institutions may be of aid, [ROOT.GetName]’s example will show all true Germans that one cannot learn battle from a classroom, but only on the battlefield!"
germil.9.a: "Excellent!"

germil.10.t: "From Standard-Leader to General"
germil.10.d: "With Germany continuing to resist the machinations by the dark forces of Marxism and liberalism in her grand struggle against international Jewry, it seems that the Stormtroopers have gone above and beyond to help Germany achieve her destiny. [ROOT.GetName]’s recent performance has shown him as not merely another low-level commander, but rather a deserving inheritor of the old Heer’s legacy."
germil.10.a: "[ROOT.GetName] has earned his place."

germil.11.t: "The People's Fury Unleashed"
germil.11.d: "Recent times have shown that our initial assumption that a war between us and the powers that be will not be a quick nor easy affair to be far more true than we would have liked. With much of the world prepared to bear down upon Germany and enslave the German people to their whims, the Volk cannot be forced to sit down and let themselves be crushed. Whilst many ways have been discussed as to how we will protect Germany, a brilliant new idea has been suggested by the paramilitaries as well as some of the army.\n\nTheir plan is one of total conscription. Whether they be old or young, all men of the Reich shall be ready to serve Germany and must undergo military training that will ensure that once the enemy comes upon our land - the people shall awaken and sweep over the enemy. Not a mere band of conscripts, but a people’s army. An army that will strike down the enemy like thunder, the Volkssturm shall be unleashed upon Germany’s foes and secure Germany her everlasting peace and glory!\n\nThis is of course not the reality on the ground. Setting up a new militia that strains our resources further - not to mention the inherent difficulties of organizing this force along with the army will no doubt prove a challenge. Still, Germany shall overcome it…\n\n...for it must survive."
germil.11.a: "...und Sturm, brich los!"

Having advocated for the Heer to be as apolitical as possible, many may naturally wonder what harm Rundstedt could possibly pose to the national revolution.\n\nOf course, we understand the gravity of the situation much better. Rundstedt is aligned with the Young Conservatives, a group of reactionaries who would sooner throw Germany into disarray than see us fulfill her destiny. Be that as it may, perhaps some reminders are in order for the old general...."
germil_con_desc_kluge: "Günther von Kluge got his nickname from his classmates at the old war academy he attended, and he has most certainly lived up to them. Privately critical of Germany’s transformation due to our supposedly extreme militarism, Kluge has thus been indicated as a potential supporter of the treacherous Young Conservatives.\n\nIn spite of that, maybe he can be made to look the other way? Kluge is but a human and if we reward him for his loyalty, perhaps we will be able to ensure the loyalty of a talented officer and leader…"
germil_con_desc_bock: "Monarchist officers have always been overrepresented in the Heer, with von Bock as no exception to this rule. Having acted as the liaison between the Reichswehr and far-right paramilitaries during the republic, Bock has become well-regarded by his colleagues and a source of anxiety in the Valkist leadership.\n\nOutspokenly in favour of the restoration of the monarchy, von Bock has not been treated lightly by the government. Still, monarchist views are not exactly the norm amongst those in the Young Conservative camp - perhaps we can amend his views or at least secure his support?"
germil_con_desc_leeb: "A Bavarian officer by heart, Wilhelm von Leeb has a rather long history with the Valkist movement. Whilst his senior in von Seeckt may have had close personal ties to Dressler, few of his peers can say the same with Dressler’s rule in Bavaria containing frequent confrontations - sometimes even violent ones between the old TST and the Reichswehr.\n\nStill, some suspect that the relatively elderly von Leeb has a certain level of fondness for the Valkist movement - making a conversion away from the Young Conservative camp not a total impossibility."
germil_con_desc_kleist: "The anti-clericalism has not served the Valkist movement well when it comes to appealing to Christians of any kind, most especially in the Heer. Ewald von Kleist certainly stands as an example of this, with him holding heavy doubts for the Valkist revolution’s success and its goal of a church totally subject to Germany.\n\nAlthough we may not be as virulently anti-Christian as the racists of the TST, some have refused any compromise in regards to the Kirchenkampf. Even if such a move would very likely move von Kleist to us, diluting the revolution would not be worth it - would it?"
germil_con_desc_beck: "Becoming one of the highest ranking officers in the Heer upon Dressler’s rise, Ludwig Beck has sadly become rather unenthusiastic for the Valkist revolution. Whispers of his doubt of our certain victory in the wars to come and his private dismay at the actions we have taken against reactionaries, it is most certainly a great shame for us to lose this once staunch Valkist.\n\nThere is little doubt as to his capability too - yet maybe we can go without him? His circle is said to be filled with defeatists of all stripes and it would not bode well for the Heer to serve without faith."
germil_con_desc_fritsch: "The Valkist movement is a revolutionary movement that will overturn all that ultimately betrayed Germany in the Great War. Curiously however, we and the reactionaries who desire a return to a worse, more feeble version of the Kaiserreich share many similar goals.\n\nThe curtailing of international capitalist-finance, the repudiation of Versailles and the restoration of German glory are all in the cards, with von Fritsch himself especially enthusiastic in this regard. Still, his status as one of the most conservative officers in the Heer makes his worth questionable to those within the Valkist movement."
germil_con_desc_brauchitsch: "Walther von Brauchitsch on the surface seems like another capable general staff officer. This of course is true, but there von Brauchitsch faces difficulty outside the general staff as well.\n\nEven though some report that he is tolerant of treacherous sentiments, some point out that von Brauchitsch will prove amenable to Valkist ideas if we can prove to him our righteousness. Rumours have also abound about von Brauchitsch’s marital and financial troubles, making him particularly susceptible to our ideas if we make an effort to convince him."
germil_con_desc_halder: "The general staff, although brilliant, has had its fair share of hostility towards the Valkist revolution. This rather unfortunate state of affairs is well exemplified by Franz Halder. A staff officer with a keen eye for operational warfare, he has had little good to say about us and his sentiments are widely shared in the general staff.\n\nHowever, some have noted Halder’s relative unwillingness to outright lambast the Valkist movement with his having privately warned against the possibility of civil war. Playing upon the natural fear of the TST will also help to go a long way in securing the general staff."

germil.12.a: "Remind him of Prussian duty and loyalty."
germil.12.b: "Bribe them."
germil.12.c: "Promise to scale back the Kirchenkampf."
germil.12.e: "Alert them to the TST threat."
germil.12.f: "Refer to our common aims."
germil.12.g: "We need no traitors in our ranks."

germil.13.t: "Reinstatement of the Heer"
germil.13.d: "Reclaiming Germany’s glory and fulfilling her destiny of empire will not be an easy process, most certainly not made easier by our initial actions. Rather short-sightedly, we opted to purge our brightest officers, along the way pushing out others who could have been turned towards the new Germany. In the meanwhile, our military has floundered with doctrinal and tactical innovations being lacking to say the least and constant insubordination and rabble-rousing from the supposed \"elite\" stormtroopers.\n\nThankfully this shall at last come to an end. With approval by the Führer, we have reinstated the many officers who have shown their willingness to return to service. Even if they are not the most courageous amongst Germans, they will prove indispensable to the goal of Germany’s victory."
germil.13.a: "Their expertise is priceless."

germil.14.t: "The Valkist Question"
germil.14.d: "Whilst we have returned many officers to their old ranks, we have yet to reinstate the officers most well-aligned with the Valkist revolution. Although the old Valkists they served were debauched fools, these officers are far more predisposed to the Germany that we are building than an old Prussian. Even if some have reservations as to inviting old valkists back - what harm could it do to Germany’s prospects?"
germil.14.a: "They were but misguided fellows."
germil.14.b: "They have no place in the new army."

germil.15.t: "Widespread Rowdiness"
germil.15.d: "Although the Volkswehr aspires to be the greatest army in Europe and the world, our steps towards restoring Germany’s martial supremacy are not without challenges. Reports of soldiers, who having transferred from the TST to the Volkswehr engaging in looting, thuggery and other scandalous behaviour have reached news headlines - shocking even the most fervent supporters of the new order. This has not been helped by the local officers involved, who have shrugged off the concerns of the public."
germil.15.a: "Are you serious?"

germil.18.t: "The Role of the Panzers"
germil.18.d: "When it comes to deciding how we will best achieve mobility in the next war, no weapon has become quite as divisive in this regard as the tank. With our attention entirely devoted to technical matters now, it has become an imperative to solve this debate before we find ourselves in the next war. There is no shortage of armour advocates within the Heer, among them men like Walther Nehring and Oswald Lutz. Advocating for the panzer to be used as the main method of achieving mobility on the battlefield, they have faced stiff opposition by traditionalists like Friedrich Fromm and Georg Lindemann - who argue that the panzer ought to be in support of the infantry."
germil.18.a: "They will do best in support roles."
germil.18.b: "They must lead us to victory!"

germil.19.t: "Kolibri"
germil.19.d: "As soon as the order came out, the Reichswehr readied themselves. The time had come for the Stormtroopers to be neutralized. In a flurry of events, the Reichswehr soldiers would soon converge upon the major TST bases across the Reich, aided by Valkist paramilitaries in their mission.\n\nSoon, all major leaders of the TST would find themselves under arrest or missing from the state’s eyes. Disgraced interim-chancellor Rudolf Jung, former agricultural minister Walther Darré and most of all the Reichsführer himself - Hermann Gauch have all found themselves under our custody with justice no doubt soon to follow. With Viktor Lutze having been reported as fleeing to the Rhineland following reports of our impending crackdown, the TST have been crippled by this decapitation strike as local TST chapters begin to break apart from one another."
germil.19.a: "They shall not be missed."
