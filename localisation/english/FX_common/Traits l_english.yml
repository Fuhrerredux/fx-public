After the execution of his brother in 1887 because of revolutionary activieties, he embraced socialism. In 1893 he moved to Leningrad and became an important revolutionary in Russia. In 1897 he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye, he married Nadezhda Krupskaya there. After the exile was over he moved to Western Europe, where he worked for the RSDLP. In 1903 the RSDLP split into two factions, the Bolshevik lead by Lenin and the Menshevik lead by Julius Martov. With the outbreak of the Feburary Revolution Germany send him in a sealed train to Russia to advocate for an end ot the war. When Kornilov marched onto Leningrad the Provisional Government requested the help of the Soviets led again by Lenin.\n\nOn 7 November in 1917 the October Revolution broke out between the Bolsheviks and Whites. In 1918 an assasination hits Lenin which causes him to peace out with Eastern Europe and make a de facto truce with the Whites in the Russian Far East. With the Russian Civil War over Lenin now focuses on armament on the nation, in order to be ready if the western powers try to crush the Soviet Union once and for all. Lenin also decentralizes the economy by giving power to the worker controlled regional and municipal councils."
