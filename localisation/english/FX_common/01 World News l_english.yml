# Alt-History Literature
fxnews.76.t: "Ernest Raymond - A Fourth Rome"
fxnews.76.d: "The rising British novelist, Ernest Raymond, has released his new book ‘A Fourth Rome’. It has become the latest major work of alternate history in the British Empire, and has had notable cultural impact on the peoples of various nations.\n\nThe novel’s plot revolves around continued hostilities between Britain and France following the 1890’s, with the general point of divergence being that German Emperor Friedrich III never picking up a habit of smoking in the 1880’s. Hostilities between Britain and France would cause Britain to seek allies to help establish influence on the continent to counter France, and the survival of the German Emperor Friedrich III had assisted in bettering relations between Britain and Germany, paving way for an alliance between the two parties. France, however, was able to coax Italy and Russia into their own Entente, nonetheless setting a stage for the Great War, which would break out initially between France and Britain over a colonial border dispute.\n\nThe war would end and result in the loss of the Entente and the victory of the Central Powers. France would soon become prey to nationalist sentiment following their loss in the Great War, resulting in the establishment of a ‘highly Militarized Republic in which service guarantees citizenship’, which arguably blurred the lines between a Republic and a Junta. France would then install a similarly styled Republican Regime in Italy following France’s intervention in the Italian Civil War, which was induced by their loss in the Great War. Marco Brescil would rise to power in this newly established Partner-State to France, and would proclaim himself as ‘Caesar’, and would announce his goal to recreate an Civilization similar to Rome in nature (rather than territorially speaking).\n\nThe novel ends with yet another war between the German-led Central Powers and French-led Entente d’Acier, as a newborn ‘Fourth Rome’ scrambles to utilize the situation to their advantage. The novel has had profound impact throughout Britain, France, and Germany, and has contributed to a mutual rise of Germanophilia and Anglophilia in Britain and Germany respectively. Despite this, it has received large amounts of flak from critics, as the notion of a prolonged survival of Friedrich III has been considered as ‘nothing more than childish’. Raymond nonetheless defends his tale, stating that ‘something like this could have happened in another Universe’."

fxnews.77.d: "The British writer known as Eric Blair has released ‘The Tides of Revolution’ earlier today, the plot of which ended up being received as shocking and controversial by a strong majority of the Imperial populace. A gripping story about a British Sailor fighting on behalf of the Freipakt in a global-scale war, the book details a world in which the Entente won the Great War, but at a dire cost. \n\nA lack of American entry to the Great War culminated in a much more drawn out and bloodier Great War, which ruined many Western member-states of the Entente. With both the Entente and Central Powers on the brink of collapse and unable to sustain further conflict; a shaky peace arrangement was reached which resulted in surprisingly little territorial concessions by either side. As the Entente was desperate to see the Bolshevik threat put down, they intervened to ensure victory of the Whites in the Russian Civil War. \n\nWith the end of a bloody Great War without any newly acquired territories to gleam, France soon fell into a civil war between the Republicans and Socialists, with the latter being the victor. In the process, all of their colonial holdings were either seized or declared independence. On the other side of the Rhine, a strong Nationalist sentiment began to rapidly brew in Germany and Russia, both of which quickly fell to Nationalist rhetoric. The two nations reached a common ground and shortly formed an alliance with the goal of ensuring global domination by the two countries. Additionally, with the British Empire passing the Statute of Westminster and steadily decentralizing coupled with the Austro-Hungarian Empire reforming into a federation of equals; the two nations quickly found themselves as the only liberal democracies remaining in Europe. In the Americas, the United States is struggling with internal politics more than ever; recent revolutions in Europe led to a colossal rise of Nationalist and Socialist sentiments, with polarization on the rise; a Civil War broke out; damaging the United States beyond repair. \n\nThe novel ends off with a 6-year strong Second Great War between the the French ‘P.R.I’, the ‘Russo-German Axis’ and the ‘Freipakt’, leading to tragic loss of life across the world. Whilst often criticized for lack of historical foundation and extensive creative liberties, it has nonetheless become a bestseller amongst the British Empire."

fxnews.78.d: "A controversial tale of by the French writer André Malraux set on a future timeline has recently reached the shelves of France, depicting a scenario of a new world order after a Second Great War.\n\nThe story is a dystopian tale set in 1962, featuring an American man surviving in the divided midwest in a world locked in a nuclear stalemate. In this timeline, the German Reich goes to war with and successfully defeats the Entente and takes control of western Europe. In the eastern front, as chaos divides the Russians, the Soviet Union too falls very quickly, causing the Stahlpakt to dominate all of the European continent. Meanwhile, in the New World, a disunited and ill United States falls to the revanchist Mexican State, the federal government collapses and splinter states rise in North America, then as the rising Mexico begins to establish its sphere of influence in the New World, it comes into conflict with the British Empire in the Caribbean, leading to a joint war with Germany against the British. The war slows down into a grinding naval stalemate, until Germany creates the ultimate weapon, powered by the atom itself. After the Mexican bomb Jamaica and Barbuda with this nuclear weapon, the British finally accept to negotiate a peace, granting Germany several of its colonial possessions overseas and giving Mexico control of the Caribbean.\n\nAs a new world order is established, German-Mexican relationships break, as well as the Stahlpakt collapses as Germany oversteps its boundaries, causing widespread resentment, up until economic crisis causes it to isolate itself. The British then begin ignoring the peace treaty terms and challenging the Reich’s influence in the world. Thus by 1962, the world is locked in a nuclear stalemate between the German Reich, the Greater Mexican State, and the British Empire, all looking to be the dominant world power.\n\nThe Novel ends with the beginning of a new nuclear crisis as the Mexican set up a missile base in their allied territory near the Great Lakes, threatening Canada, and causing the worldwide panic as the British prepare to deal with this aggression. While many criticize the book for its huge gaps in plausibility and exaggerated proposals of future technology, the gripping political tension that wraps every part of the story has lead it to great success amongst all of the Entente."

This groundbreaking work of alternate history has captured the imagination of readers worldwide, leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape.\n\nSet in a divergent reality where the 1919 German revolution triumphed, \"The Legacy of the Revolution\" paints a vivid tableau of a transformed Europe. In this world, visionary socialist Rosa Luxemburg ascends to the presidency of the German People’s state in 1926, heralding an era of progressive governance marked by democracy and civil liberties. Meanwhile, across the Rhine, the French populace rises in defiance against their government, plunging the nation into a bitter civil conflict that culminates in the establishment of the French State. The British, opting for non-intervention, watch as their continental neighbors grapple with upheaval.\n\nYet amidst the turmoil, pockets of resistance persist. The Kingdom of Italy, under the leadership of Emmanuel III and social liberal Prime Minister Ivanoe Bonomi, joins forces with the Hellenic Empire, led by Emperor George II, forging the formidable \"Athens-Rome Pact\". Together, they assert dominance over the Balkans, bolstered by puppet states in Croatia, Slovenia, and Albania. Turkey, once a regional power, lies in ruins, its demise orchestrated by Greek and Italian forces keen on reshaping the geopolitical landscape. The emergence of liberated entities like the Kingdom of Pontus and the Kingdom of Antioch signals a seismic shift in the balance of power.\n\nIn the Middle East, the Kingdom of Hejaz emerges as a formidable adversary to the Athens-Rome Pact, while Hungary extends its influence over the northern Balkan territories, subjugating Czechia and Transylvania as vassal states.
