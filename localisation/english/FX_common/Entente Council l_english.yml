##### Events #####
FRA.council.1.t: "France invites us to join the Entente Military Alliance"
FRA.council.1.d: "To truely help keep Europe safe it has become clear to France that the Entente Council must become a military alliance capable of directly supporting all of it's members. Paris sees our participation in this alliance as key to it's success but while the guarantee of protection is a warm welcome the responsibilities that come with it are not as popular but the threat of Germany and the Soviets may force us to strongly consider France's invitation."
FRA.council.1.a: "We shall join"
FRA.council.1.b: "We do not need [FROM.GetName]'s help"

FRA.council.2.t: "Dissolution of the Entente Council"
FRA.council.2.d: "The Entente Council's repeated failures to keep Europe stable have ruined the organization's reputation beyond repair. Members no longer pay their dues and have no faith in France's ability to protect them. Without some major changes the future of Europe is beginning to look bleak."
FRA.council.2.a: "Shameful..."

FRA.council.3.t: "Dissolution of the Entente Council"
FRA.council.3.d: "The Entente Council's repeated failures to keep Europe stable have ruined the organization's reputation beyond repair. We have no reason to continue to associate with the French and must fend for ourselves. Without some major changes the future of Europe is beginning to look bleak."
FRA.council.3.a: "Ominous."

FRA.council.4.t: "France and The Entente Council declare war on [Root.GetName]"
FRA.council.4.d: "The cowards in Paris have spread propaganda to the nations of Europe convincing them that we are a threat to European security, a humorous accusation coming from the French of all people. In any case we find ourselves in the first major European war since the Great War nearly 20 years ago. What we do next will define the world for decades to come. Against all odds we will beat the French and earn our place as the sole superpower of Europe."
FRA.council.4.a: "To total victory!"

FRA.council.5.t: "[From.GetName] requests material support"
FRA.council.5.d: "[From.GetName] has requested, in accordance to Entente Council policy, military materials to help defend their nation in their current conflict. While we are obligated to provide support for nations in need the recent global economic down turn that has already limited our ability to support ourselves let alone another nation."
FRA.council.5.a: "While shall give support to the [From.GetName]"
FRA.council.5.b: "France isn't in a position to help"

FRA.council.6.t: "France sends material support"
FRA.council.6.d: "France has listened to our pleas and now sends needed support for our cause. Now we are in a better position to defend our nation and European liberalism as a whole."
FRA.council.6.a: "[Root.GetName] gives a toast to our French ally"

FRA.council.8.t: "France refuses to send material support"
FRA.council.8.d: "France has ignored to our pleas and refuses send needed support for our cause. It is clear that France has no interests in the security of Europe and we will need to fend for ourselves."
FRA.council.8.a: "The French are backstabbers"

FRA.council.9.t: "Germany pushes an aggressive foreign policy"
FRA.council.9.d: "Berlin has announced today their intention to reclaim 'lost German lands stolen by France and the Versailles treaty'. Despite our best efforts to contain German expansionism our threats towards Germany ring hollow. It's only a matter of time until Germany drags Europe into another grand conflict."
FRA.council.9.a: "We must prepare §R(Entente Member's Confidence drops by 10%)§!"

FRA.council.10.t: "Germany publishes propaganda against the Entente"
FRA.council.10.d: "In an attempt to undermine us and the Entente Council, Germany has published a pamphlet claiming of mass abuses of power in our colonies and the Rhineland. Children being separated by their mothers at gun point and French forces burning entire villages to the ground are some of the least insulting claims made by the Germans. These accusations are highly exaggerated but some nations seem very convinced despite this."
FRA.council.10.a: "This is truly embarrassing. §R(Entente Member's Confidence drops by 10%)§!"

FRA.council.11.t: "[From.GetName] requests funding for fortifications"
FRA.council.11.d: "Germany's aggressive foreign policy has the government of [From.GetName] worried about the future of their sovereignty. They now request that we help fund fortification efforts to help defend their nation from a German attack."
FRA.council.11.a: "We shall support [From.GetName] §R(Entente Member's Confidence rises by 5%)§!"
FRA.council.11.b: "We can't spare anything §R(Entente Member's Confidence drops by 10%)§!"

FRA.council.12.t: "[From.GetName] invites us to cooperate on research and development"
FRA.council.12.d: "[From.GetName] has proposed that to help guarantee the stability of Europe, Entente Council members must cooperate on technological developments that will help keep members safe. While the assistance will help us immensely, some in our government worry that surrendering our technological advancements will make us vulnerable to our neighbors."
FRA.council.12.a: "We shall participate"
FRA.council.12.b: "We're better on our own"

FRA.council.13.t: "[From.GetName] invites us to the Entente military exercise"
FRA.council.13.d: "The defense of Europe requires all members of the Entente Council to maintain a well trained and modern army. France has invited us to a pan-European military exercise to support our armed forces in completing this goal. Most support accepting France's offer but some ministers worry about becoming too dependent on France"
FRA.council.13.a: "We shall participate"
FRA.council.13.b: "We're better on our own"

FRA.council.15.t: "[From.GetName] offers to build anti-German defenses"
FRA.council.15.d: "As Germany continues to expand it's military it's clear that their expansionist ambitions are beginning to turn towards us. Realizing this the Entente Council at the behest of [From.GetName] has offered to build our nation defenses to help protect against an possible German invasion."
FRA.council.15.a: "We must accept"
FRA.council.15.b: "The Council means nothing to us"

FRA.council.16.t: "[From.GetName] has accepted our offer"
FRA.council.16.d: "Realizing the growing threat of Germany [From.GetName] has accepted our offer to build defenses in their nation"
FRA.council.16.a: "We must be prepared for German intervention"

FRA.council.17.t: "[From.GetName] has refused our offer"
FRA.council.17.d: "Despite the growing threat of Germany [From.GetName] has refused our offer to build defenses in their nation"
FRA.council.17.a: "The lack of confidence in the Entente Council is unfortunate"

FRA.council.18.t: "[From.GetName] offers to build anti-German defenses"
FRA.council.18.d: "As Germany continues to expand it's military it's clear that their expansionist ambitions are beginning to turn towards us. Realizing this the Entente Council at the behest of [From.GetName] has offered to build our nation defenses to help protect against an possible German invasion."
FRA.council.18.a: "We must accept"
FRA.council.18.b: "The Council means nothing to us"

FRA.council.19.t: "[From.GetName] offers to build anti-German defenses"
FRA.council.19.d: "As Germany continues to expand it's military it's clear that their expansionist ambitions are beginning to turn towards us. Realizing this the Entente Council at the behest of [From.GetName] has offered to build our nation defenses to help protect against an possible German invasion."
FRA.council.19.a: "We must accept"
FRA.council.19.b: "The Council means nothing to us"

FRA.council.20.t: "[From.GetName] offers to build anti-German defenses"
FRA.council.20.d: "As Germany continues to expand it's military it's clear that their expansionist ambitions are beginning to turn towards us. Realizing this the Entente Council at the behest of [From.GetName] has offered to build our nation defenses to help protect against an possible German invasion."
FRA.council.20.a: "We must accept"
FRA.council.20.b: "The Council means nothing to us"

FRA.council.21.t: "Intervention in the Congo"
FRA.council.21.d: "With the far-left uprising in Belgium, we find ourselves forced to take unilateral action to secure the safety of our colonies in Africa. As it stands today, the Belgian Congo faces the possibilty of falling into the hands of socialists or declaring outright independence. Neither of these options are viable. \n\n Many within our own government and on the Entente Council are pushing us to occupy the Congo, though doing so will surely upset the British, whose colonies are also in close proximity to the land in question. Some are urging us to form a joint strategy with the Imperial Protection Alliance and split the territory until the situation in Belgium can be resolved, though others still urge us to take unilateral action. Regardless of which option we choose, time is of the essence if we want to contain the spread of socialist ideas to our colonies in Africa."
FRA.council.21.a: "Let's negotiate with the British to peacefully jointly occupy the colony."
FRA.council.21.b: "We don't need the British in on this. Occupy all of the Congo!"

FRA.council.22.t: "We have been removed from the Entente Council"
FRA.council.22.d: "After our recent change of ideology, the Entente has been very disappointed with us. They decided they didn't want to allow us to remain, and thus they removed us."
FRA.council.22.a: "They will regret this decision..."

FRA.council.23.t: "A Renewed Entente?"
FRA.council.23.d: "Whilst we have always held similar global strategic plans with the former Entente, our mutual differences on the precise details and enforcement of such the post-1919 order has led to it collapsing into a flaming mess with the resurgence of a vengeful Germany and vicious Russia turned red. Now that we have both been made to take a stand against Germany's unabashed expansion, [FROM.GetNameDef] has reached out to us requesting that we reform the Entente of old to once and for all put down German imperialist ambition.\n\nWhilst such a request may have been laughed off before recent events, Germany's continuous rampage throughout Europe has stirred the great powers awake as the time has come - the eagle's wings must be clipped once and for all."
FRA.council.23.a: "We fight for freedom!"
FRA.council.23.b: "Let's not be too hasty"
form_united_nations_alliance: "§gFor the remaining duration of the war, we shall fight alongside [FROM.GetNameDef] until all wars have been won. Afterwards, we can opt to reform our old alliance.§!"

FRA.council.24.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses!"
FRA.council.24.d: "The [FROM.GetName] has refused our request to merge our war efforts, citing our strategic differences as a reason. Whilst this is clearly a selfish, short-sighted attempt to attain glory for themselves, it is nonetheless a great shame for us that we will not be able to more efficiently and effectively bring the war to a speedy conclusion."
FRA.council.24.a: "Whatever happened to the spirit of 1916?"

FRA.council.25.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts"
FRA.council.25.d: "With the acceptance of our request by [FROM.GetNameDef], the war now looks ever less bleak for us as we stand together once again against Berlin's imperialist dreams. Even if this is just the first stepping stone towards victory, we can be sure that the vile Hun is quaking in his boots!"
ENT_reform_entente_response: "To the final struggle for freedom and peace!"
IPA_reform_entente_response: "We'll hang out the washing on the Siegfried line - if the Siegfried line is still there!"
USA_reform_entente_response: "United we shall stand!"

FRA.council.26.t: "The Entente Splinters"
FRA.council.26.d: "With the war over and peace restored to our nations, it appears that [FROM.GetNameDef] has opted to go their own way once again. Whilst this move is not explicitly hostile, it has been received with negativity in [THIS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as it is undoubtedly disappointing that [FROM.GetNameDef] has displayed its willingness to abandon our brotherhood in the defence of freedom."
FRA.council.26.a: "So be it"

FRA.council.27.t: "Return to Our Old Faction?"
FRA.council.27.d: "During the war against Germany, we opted to join our allies in the great struggle against German imperialism. Now with the struggle over, our former allies have decided to go their own way once more, reforming the alliance we were once part of. Now we must decide whether or not to join them once more or if we are better off forging our own path in the world."
FRA.council.27.a: "Of course!"
FRA.council.27.b: "Maybe not..."

FRA.council.28.t: "The United Nations Alliance"
FRA.council.28.d: "With the fall of France, the fate of the world in the face of German imperialism has never looked grimmer. Yet, as we prepare to bring the fight to the Huns once and for all, we have found that the alliance has become less and less referred to as the Entente and; with the variety of nations behind it, have increasingly been described as the United Nations Alliance. Such a name has resonated well with the mainly Anglo leadership of the alliance and now many are beginning to question whether a French name - associated with imperial subjugation by many is a fitting descriptor of our alliance."
FRA.council.28.a: "We must shed the French baggage."
FRA.council.28.b: "But Entente is a cool name..."

FRA.council.29.t: "Collapse of the Entente"
FRA.council.29.d: "With all of the Entente's European members defeated and now under the great pressures of occupation, only the international members of the alliance remain standing. However, the near-total lack of proper communication between our disparate nations has resulted in the Entente being nothing more than a great fiction with a ultimately tragic history. It seems that our foes have gotten the better of us..."
FRA.council.29.a: "..."
FRA.council.29.b: "It is time to withdraw from this pointless war..."

FRA.council.30.t: "[FROM.GetName] Requests Armistice"
FRA.council.30.d: "To the enthusiasm of our people and armies, the devilish Entente has dissolved, with all that remains being their disunited allies over the seas. With their cause lost, it appears that [FROM.GetNameDef] desires to withdraw from the war and cease hostility with us. While it would certainly be easier to simply let bygones be bygones however, some point out that we have overseas allies who are able to effectively secure these potential future enemies - making white peace unnecessary."
FRA.council.30.a: "Accept them."
FRA.council.30.b: "We will be marching in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] in no time!"

FRA.council.32.t: "The German Issue"
FRA.council.32.d: "When [GER.GetLeader] took power in Germany he promised his supporters that he would restore the Reich's former glory. It is clear now that he is willing to do this at any cost. When the London Stock Market Crash swept through France and Europe, [GER.GetLeader] took the opportunity to announce that Germany would no longer abide to the Treaty of Versailles. As our delegates speak the German war machine that lead to the deaths of over 20 million people during the Great War roars back to life. \n\n It has been agreed early on that France and the greater European community are in no shape to disarm Germany by force but if we take action now we may be able to cripple [GER.GetLeader]'s goal of rearmament. Germany is incredible dependent on it's neighbors for it's industrial sector. If we can agree on proper weapon sanctions we could bring Germany's arms industry to a halt but many delegates worry that hurting there own arms industry in the middle of a recession isn't worth the small diplomatic foot hold over Germany."
FRA.council.32.a: "They must be stopped!"
FRA.council.32.b: "This is not worth risking our interests over."

FRA.council.33.t: "A Final Decision on Germany"
FRA.council.33.d: "After hours of arguing a final vote on the German issue has been reached. Proponents believe that sanctioning the German arms industry will cripple Germany's ability to wage an offensive war but opponents believe that this would only damage there nation's own arms industry which relies on German income to survive."
FRA.council.33.a: "The council rejects any action against Germany!"
FRA.council.33.b: "Delegates agree to sanction Germany!"

FRA.council.34.t: "No Sanctions on Germany" 
FRA.council.34.d: "After hours of debates the Entente Council voted against sanctioning Germany. Fears that this action would hurt there own arms industry ran rampant through the delegates chamber. France will now have to find her own ways of dealing with Germany."
FRA.council.34.a: "The German threat is overblown anyways."

FRA.council.35.t: "Sanctions on Germany"
FRA.council.35.d: "After hours of debate the Entente Council has voted to sanction Germany. Most delegates were swayed by the hope that sanctioning the German arms industry would destroy there plans for rearmament. Only time will tell if this proves true."
FRA.council.35.a: "This will surely stop any German war plans"

FRA.council.36.t: "Entente Sanctions"
FRA.council.36.d: "The cowardly French have pressured a horde of nations to sanction our country in attempt to damage our arms industry. The Entente and their allies will no longer sell arms and weapon manufacturing equipment to our nation. Despite French hopes though this will only be a small road block in the way towards our goal of a German dominated Europe."
FRA.council.36.a: "Economic wars are a coward's conflict!"

FRA.council.37.t: "Unified Strategy for Economic Recovery"
FRA.council.37.d: "The London Stock Market Crash has caused what may be the greatest economic recces ion to ever effect Europe. Unemployment sores as companies and businesses are no longer able to keep there doors open. France has drafted an economic recovery plan to asst Europe through this disaster. In it our nation would be obligated to increase taxes on high earners and use the profits to subsidies currently operational business. In addition to this we would also need to keep exporting resources to Entente Council members that require them in an attempt to keep there industry operating. The hope is that these policies will prevent any further bankruptcies and stop the rapid unemployment. Many delegates worry that these policies are too rigid and don't take into account the specific needs that each individual nation may have."
FRA.council.37.a: "We must agree to the French plan.."
FRA.council.37.b: "Economic co-dependence got us into this mess in the first place!"

FRA.council.38.t: "A Final Decision on Economic Recovery"
FRA.council.38.d: "After hours of arguments a final vote on how to approach the economic recovery has been made. Proponents argue that economic cooperation and austerity policies will be needed to overcome the recession while opponents argue that the French economic recovery plan is is too rigid and fails to address the specific needs of individual nations."
FRA.council.38.a: "The council fails to agree on a recovery plan!"
FRA.council.38.b: "Delegates agree to the French plan!"

FRA.council.39.t: "No United Recovery Plan"
FRA.council.39.d: "The Entente Council could not come into agreement over an economic recovery strategy. The French plan failed to resonate with the other delegates."
FRA.council.39.a: "It looks like we will be on our own..."

FRA.council.40.t: "The French Recovery Plan"
FRA.council.40.d: "Despite initial opposition to the French plan, the council delegates have agreed to support it and institute it's policy's within there own nations. In times of real struggle international cooperation is vital."
FRA.council.40.a: "Together we will get pass this disaster!"

FRA.council.41.t: "Recognition for the Soviet Union?"
FRA.council.41.d: "The Great War was a conflict so devastating it brought down the most powerful and vast continuous empire to ever exist, Russia. After 3 brutal years of war the Russian state fell into a civil war where the liberal White forces fought the collectivist Red forces. Eventually the Reds were victorious and many White leaders were forced to flee Russia. Many of these men ended up in Paris. In an act of solidarity with there former Russian ally the French and the Entente agreed not to recognize the USSR as the legitimate Russian state. While this once served the interests of the Entente the rising threat of Germany may force us to reconsider this policy. Being on good terms with the Soviets may help deter German aggression."
FRA.council.41.a: "It is childish to ignore the Soviets."
FRA.council.41.b: "We will never recognize the Bolsheviks!"

FRA.council.42.t: "A Final Decision on Soviet Recognition"
FRA.council.42.d: "After hours of arguing the delegates have gathered to make a decision on the status of the USSR. Pro-recognition delegates argue that the USSR is too powerful of a nation to ignore and ideological obsession with the defeated Whites does none of our nations good while Anti-recognition delegates argue that granting the Soviets any legitimacy will give inspiration to collectivist back home who will take our action as a sign of support."
FRA.council.42.a: "The Council votes against Soviet recognition!"
FRA.council.42.b: "Delegates agree to recognize the Soviet Union!"

FRA.council.43.t: "The Illegitimacy of Bolshevism"
FRA.council.43.d: "Despite the growing threat of the German Reich the Entente Council has chosen to continue there policy against the Soviet Union. The Entente will continue not recognizing the USSR as the legitimate Russian state."
FRA.council.43.a: "Moscow was never trustworthy anyways."

FRA.council.44.t: "Recognition of the Soviet Union"
FRA.council.44.d: "In a surprising turn of events the Entente Council has announced that it will recognize the Soviet Union as the legitimate Russian state. Former White officers living in Paris have denounced this action calling the Council 'A rotten den full of back stabbers'."
FRA.council.44.a: "Hopefully the Germans notice this!"

FRA.council.45.t: "Recognition from the West"
FRA.council.45.d: "France has announced the Entente Council will now recognize us as the true successor to the former Russian Empire. The French have even offered us the former Russian embassy in Paris for Soviet use. This warming of relations between our nations gives our Revolution and struggle legitimacy upon the world stage."
FRA.council.45.a: "Interesting..."
